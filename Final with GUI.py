"We all know that Christmas is a special time of year, but some people take it to the next level with their decorations. This essay will explore the history and beauty of Victorianstyle Christmas decorations, focusing specifically on the use of walnut shells as tree ornaments during this period. The tradition of decorating trees at Christmastime began in Germany in the 16th century and quickly spread into England by the 18th century. During this era, craftsmen found novel ways to express their holiday spirit through unique ornamentation techniques such as creating walnut shell ornaments for trees. The popularity of these homemade creations grew exponentially over time however, it was not until Queen Victorias reign that they truly gained widespread recognition throughout Europe and America alike. Walnuts have been used for centuries in various forms from food to dyeing cloth  making them an obvious choice for festive adornment due to their size, shape and availability at a reasonable cost. These small shells could be painted with intricate designs or embellished with glittery sequins and beads before being hung from branch tips using brightly colored thread or string  giving traditional evergreen trees an added sparkle when seen from afar. Moreover, there were other more practical uses associated with these ornamental nuts many believed that hanging walnut shells on doorways would bring good luck while others asserted they acted as a form of protection against evil spirits entering ones home during winter months apparently due to their strong smell. In addition to acting as eyecatching dcor pieces around your dwelling place victorianstyle walnut shell christmas decorations also served both symbolic and superstitious purposes within society which likely made them even more enjoyable than they already were. .

"The importance of the Conservation of Endangered Species is often overlooked by many people today. While human activities may have drastically altered the global environment, there are still species that have managed to survive in spite of these changes. Unfortunately, due to agricultural and urban development, as well as increased hunting and fishing pressure on specific animals, a number of species are now facing extinction. This has caused great concern among scientists who understand the consequences this could mean for future generations if no action is taken soon. Conservation efforts focus on protecting endangered species from further decline or even total extinction. These measures include laws and regulations put in place to protect those threatened with endangerment, such as strict hunting restrictions or habitat protection programs introducing controlled reintroductions of large populations into areas where they previously existed captive breeding programs which allow endangered species to breed in safety away from predators and research into gene technology designed specifically for conservation purposes such as identifying important characteristics necessary for survival or finding new ways to combat diseases like cancer found more frequently in certain threatened species than others. Perhaps one of the most significant benefits provided by conservation efforts is the potential benefit it can bring not just to nature but also economically speaking through ecotourism opportunities associated with particular ecosystems holding endangered wildlife. For instance, tourists may be drawn towards an area inhabited by rare animals like pandas  creating jobs related specifically catering towards their needs while preserving habitats at the same time Additionally conserving threatened plants can ensure sustainability when it comes food production  vital resources essential during times when other sources become scarce due to poor weather conditions etcetera The list goes on. All things considered, conservation projects should be viewed favorably since they offer longterm rewards both economically and environmentally  helping provide some relief from our current negative effects on nature whilst providing us with knowledge about animal behavior or disease prevention strategies which would otherwise remain unknown without them We need only look up pictures showcasing natural wonders around world before  after humans influenced them ,",

"Background  Immunological characteristics of COVID19 show pathological hyperinflammation associated with lymphopenia and dysfunctional T cell responses  These features provide a rationale for restoring functional T cell immunity in COVID19 patients by adoptive transfer of SARSCoV2 specific T cells  Methods  To generate SARSCoV2 specific T cells  we isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 7 COVID19 recovered and 13 unexposed donors  Consequently  we stimulated cells with SARSCoV2 peptide mixtures covering spike  membrane and nucleocapsid proteins  Then  we culture expanded cells with IL2 for 21 days  We assessed immunophenotypes  cytokine profiles  antigen specificity of the final cell products  Results  Our results show that SARSCoV2 specific T cells could be expanded in both COVID19 recovered and unexposed groups  Immunophenotypes were similar in both groups showing CD4  T cell dominance  but CD8  and CD3 CD56  T cells were also present  Antigen specificity was determined by ELISPOT  intracellular cytokine assay  and cytotoxicity assays  One out of 14 individuals who were previously unexposed to SARSCoV2 failed to show antigen specificity  Moreover  exvivo expanded SARSCoV2 specific T cells mainly consisted of central and effector memory subsets with reduced alloreactivity against HLAunmatched cells suggesting the possibility for the development of thirdparty partial HLAmatching products  Discussion  In conclusion  our findings show that SARSCoV2 specific T cell can be readily expanded from both COVID19 and unexposed individuals and can therefore be manufactured as a biopharmaceutical product to treat severe COVID19 patients  One Sentence Summary  Exvivo expanded SARSCoV2 antigen specific T cells developed as thirdparty partial HLAmatching products may be a promising approach for treating severe COVID19 patients that do not respond to previous treatment options,",

"The impacts of climate change on the Great Barrier Reef are both profound and farreaching. Located off the coast of Queensland, Australia, this magnificent World Heritage Site is one of the most biologically diverse and stunningly beautiful marine ecosystems in the world. However, due to increasing global temperatures caused by human activity, it has been subject to unprecedented environmental damage in recent years. Climate change has had a devastating effect on the Great Barrier Reef in many ways. The warming waters surrounding it have caused coral bleaching events which occur when algae living inside corals die off due to high water temperatures or other stressors such as pollution or overfishing. This not only kills large portions of live coral but also leads to population declines in fish species that rely on them for shelter and sustenance. Additionally, ocean acidification caused by rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide affects sea lifes ability to form calcium carbonate shells, which are essential components for their survival and growth rates throughout their lifespan. The effects of global warming will be felt deep into future generations if urgent action is not taken now by governments around the world to reduce emissions from burning fossil fuels and preserve our planets natural resources with more sustainable practices like recycling plastic waste instead discarding it into oceans as well as preventing illegal fishing activities. In addition, programs must be implemented that focus on mitigating existing threats posed to reefs through methods such as developing heatresistant coral varieties or helping local communities improve livelihoods so they can better afford conservation efforts while still sustaining themselves economically  these sorts of solutions require investment at all scales individual citizens must take personal responsibility too. Ultimately though, protecting and preserving this incredible ecosystem is an effort we all must make together if we are serious about halting irreversible damage brought upon us through climate change it should be considered a shared responsibility between societies everywhere who enjoy its beauty regardless whether they live next door or thousands miles away With ongoing public awareness campaigns about how each,",

In each scenario, I recognized that failure would always exist as a possibility but allowed it not just remain as such  instead using setbacks as a means for selfimprovement rather than letting disappointment define me personally or professionally.

"The history of mathematics is a fascinating topic to explore. It has been said that its the language of the universe, and while this may be an overstatement, theres no denying that the development of mathematical knowledge has played an immense role in shaping modern society. From ancient Babylonians calculating time by tracking lunar cycles to beyond today with advanced computing capabilities, mathematics has always existed as a tool for understanding and manipulating our environment. The earliest known evidence of math dates back to 3700 B.C., when accounting tokens were used in Mesopotamia for basic economic transactions. Additionally, at around 3000 B.C., Babylonian cuneiform tablets offer insight into early mathematic developments concerning geometry and even Pythagorean Theoremlike problems  these tablets illustrate how different societies developed their own mathematical systems independently from one another without outside influence or contact from other cultures. In Ancient Greece during 600300 BC we begin to see more advancements made in mathematics thanks to philosophers like Thales and Euclid who laid out foundations for geometric concepts such as congruence, parallel lines, circles and triangles  some which still hold relevance today This period was also crucial in developing arithmetic methods including fractions which had previously not been understood. From there on out we start seeing advances in algebraic equations with Diophantuss Arithmetica 250 A.D., new number systems like decimal numbers invented by Chinese mathematician Zu Chongzhi 470 A.D. , differential calculus pioneered by Isaac Newton 1687 , nilpotent elements discovered by variste Galois 1830, Boolean algebra introduced by George Boole1847 etc. All of these are just a glimpse into what would eventually become calculusa field which enables us now to solve complex scientificengineering problems quickly via computers using numerical techniques such as integrationdifferentiation formulas or series expansions . .

"Background  The current propagation models of COVID19 are poorly consistent with existing epidemiological data and with evidence that the SARSCoV2 genome is mutating  for potential aggressive evolution of the disease  Objectives  We looked for fundamental variables that were missing from current analyses  Among them were regional climate heterogeneity  viral evolution processes versus founder effects  and largescale virus containment measures  Methods  We challenged regional versus genetic evolution models of COVID19 at a wholepopulation level  over 168 089 laboratoryconfirmed SARSCoV2 infection cases in Italy  Spain  and Scandinavia at early timepoints of the pandemic  Diffusion data in Germany  France  and the United Kingdom provided a validation dataset of 210 239 additional cases  Results  Mean doubling time of COVID19 cases was 6 63 days in Northern versus 5 38 days in Southern Italy  Spain extended this trend of faster diffusion in Southern Europe  with a doubling time of 4 2 days  Slower doubling times were observed in Sweden  9 4 days   Finland  10 8 days   and Norway  12 95 days   COVID19 doubling time in Germany  7 0 days   France  7 5 days   and the United Kingdom  7 2 days  supported the North South gradient model  Clusters of SARSCoV2 mutations upon sequential diffusion were not found to clearly correlate with regional distribution dynamics  Conclusion  Acquisition of mutations upon SARSCoV2 spreading failed to explain regional diffusion heterogeneity at early pandemic times  Our findings indicate that COVID19 transmission rates are rather associated with a sharp North South climate gradient  with faster spreading in Southern regions  Thus  warmer climate conditions may not limit SARSCoV2 infectivity  Very cold regions may be better spared by recurrent courses of SARSCoV2 infection,",

"Background  Women living with HIV in Indonesia encounter challenging obstacles to healthcare  which is exacerbated by COVID19  Access is difficult as there are limited numbers of poorly supported healthcare providers  Women also face significant stigma when disclosing their HIVstatus  Objectives  Our main purpose is to give a voice to disempowered women living with HIV  by normalising the discussion of HIV  to empower health professionals to better understand the issues faced by women living with HIV  and develop improved treatment practices  Design  Our project was guided by a Feminist Participatory Action Research  FPAR  framework  FPAR refers to  a participatory and actionoriented approach to research that centres gender and women s experiences both theoretically and practically   It creates meaningful participation for women throughout the research process  ensuring a collective critical consciousness that challenges oppressive attitudes  beliefs  and practices that may be deeply embedded in society  Method  Purposive sampling and a thematic analysis was applied to focus group discussions with 20 women living with HIV and 20 women without HIV in Palembang  South Sumatra  Results  When women living with HIV face a difficult decision  do they disclose their status knowing that they may face stigma and even a refusal to be treated  or do they conceal their status and face not receiving the right care  In this article  we explore the stories of women living with HIV as they seek medical treatment during the COVID19 pandemic  We show that there is no optimal solution for women as they lose whether they disclose their HIV status or not  Conclusion  Women s stories around HIV and COVID19 intersect with conditions such as poverty and discrimination  as well as embedded gender systems  creating overlapping barriers to treatment  Government must challenge this culture by introducing a comprehensive sex and HIV education programme  This would normalise discussions of HIVrelated topics  leading to improved health outcomes,",

"In this day and age, texting has become an integral part of everyday life. From staying in touch with friends and family to conducting business, many people find themselves relying heavily on the convenience of texting for communication. As such, it is important to understand what constitutes proper text etiquette in order to maintain relationships and stay professional. When considering how best to approach someone via text, it is important to remember that the same politeness you would show if speaking facetoface should be extended over a text message as well. This means avoiding any overly aggressive or sarcastic language when conveying a message or point of view. Instead one should strive for diplomacy by expressing how they feel without insulting another persons opinion or feelings messages should remain as positive as possible even when discussing difficult topics. Alongside being polite during conversations, it is also essential to remember basic spelling and grammar rules before sending texts out into the worldespecially if sending them professionally Before hitting send on a work related message it can be incredibly beneficial to read through your words carefully so that there are no typos or grammatical errors presentthese sorts of mistakes can make you appear unprofessional which could ultimately lead clients away from working with you further down the line. Lastly but certainly not least is maintaining appropriate responses times when texting other individualsits safe say that we all have had those moments where we see a small speech bubble pop up next our messages only for us wait days or sometimes weeks later for them reply back  this isnt very cool at all To avoid making others feel like theyve been ignored try respond promptly after receiving notifications this goes double if talking about business matters Its important not only acknowledge receipt quickly but also answer questionsinquiries within 24 hours at most letting too much time elapse between replies will instantly make your brand look sloppy in comparison its competition who might have faster response times than yours do  something worth,",

For many, discovering something new offers a unique sense of accomplishment, but for some it is an opportunity to reach for something morea chance to push oneself outside ones comfort zone and into uncharted territory. Longdistance hiking is becoming increasingly popular as people seek out this type of thrill and challenge. Longdistance hiking consists of traversing vast stretches typically over 100 miles across remote terrain with minimal supplies and little support from civilization. The experience itself can be incredibly rewarding not only does longdistance hiking present physical challenges that require perseverance and strength, but mentally it provides a test as well in terms of endurance and problem solving along the way. A successful hike requires research, preparation, knowledge about navigation techniques, environmental awareness and often times involves intricate route planning in order to maximize time on trail while minimizing unnecessary potential risks or hazards associated with certain terrains or weather conditions. Though there are undoubtedly numerous rewards associated with longdistance hiking such as a greater appreciation for nature or moments of spiritual renewal found during solitude on the trail it is important to understand that these types journeys come with risks as well whether they be natural hazards like wild animals or unpredictable weather patterns that can quickly become dangerous if unprepared for them adequately. That said having proper gear including good quality backpacking equipment such as sleeping bagpad tents stoves water filtration systems among other items will go a long way towards protecting against any unforeseen issues encountered on trail so doing your due diligence beforehand is key when planning any sort trip. . To sum up those thinking about taking off into unknown parts should consider both benefits and drawbacks before setting out because although there may be thrilling moments discovery along your journey unexpected events can arise unexpectedly leaving you potentially ill prepared yet also highly inspired by pushing yourself beyond what was thought possible,",

"Creating a successful small business is one of the most rewarding endeavors an individual can undertake. It takes hard work, dedication, and determination to make it past the initial hurdles of getting off the ground. The following essay will explore some of the key components necessary for setting up a successful small business in todays economic landscape. The first step towards success is to develop a sound business plan and financial projection. An entrepreneur should always have clear goals set out on what they want their company to achieve and how they are going to get there financially. Knowing which products or services you will offer, who your target market is, what pricing structures youll use and where profits should come from can help focus energy into important tasks that will move your dream forward quickly. Doing adequate research ahead of time on legal requirements, potential customers, cost analysis etc., can also save both time and money down the line when launching a new enterprise. Secondly, its important for entrepreneurs looking to start a business on their own to consider obtaining professional advice as needed throughout their process whether that be from experienced mentors or knowledgeable professionals such as accountants or attorneys specialized in small businesses who could provide guidance during various stages of development before launch day. Additionally many budding businesses may find that seeking external investors provides an opportunity to get started sooner rather than later whilst also having access to greater resources and expertise in order reach commercial success quicker than if working with limited funds alone . Finally marketing strategies are often overlooked by aspiring business owners but arguably it plays one of the most crucial roles when trying establish presence within competitive markets without breaking budgets prematurely . Some tactical ways could include social media campaigns targeting ideal customer demographics , blog post creation about relevant topics attracting potential clients attention , leveraging organic search engine optimization techniques like link building  content marketing along with creative advertising methods tailored around individual budget constraints . Ultimately by utilizing all available promotional channels strategically new companies increase chances substantially for succeeding longterm . . Overall starting  running any,",

"Perceived risk clearly impacts travel behavior  including destination selection and satisfaction  but it is unclear how or why its effect is only significant in certain cases  This is because existing studies have undervalued the mediating factors of risk aversion  government initiatives  and media influence as well as the multiple forms or dimensions of risk that can mask its direct effect  This study constructs a structural equation model of perceived risk s impact on destination image and travel intention for a more nuanced model of the perceived risk mechanism in tourism  based on 413 equestionnaires regarding travel to Chengdu  China during the COVID19 pandemic  using the Bootstrap method to analyze suppressing effect  It finds that while perceived risk has a significant negative impact on destination image and travel intention  this is complexly mediated so as to appear insignificant  Furthermore  different mediating factors and dimensions of perceived risk operate differently according to their varied combinations in actual circumstances  This study is significant because it provides a theoretical interpretation of tourism risk  elucidates the mechanisms or paths by which perceived risk affects travel intention  and expands a framework for research on destination image and travel intention into the realms of psychology  political  and communication science  It additionally encourages people to pay greater attention to the negative impact of crises and focuses on the important role of internal and external responses in crisis management  which can help improve the effectiveness of crisis management and promote the sustainable development of the tourism industry,",
"The outbreak of coronavirus disease  COVID19  has transformed the daily lifestyles of people worldwide  COVID19 was characterized as a pandemic owing to its global spread  and technologies based on engineered materials that help to reduce the spread of infections have been reported  Nanotechnology present in materials with enhanced physicochemical properties and versatile chemical functionalization offer numerous ways to combat the disease  Facemasks are a reliable preventive measure  although they are not 100  effective against viral infections  Nonwoven materials  which are the key components of masks  act as barriers to the virus through filtration  However  there is a high chance of crossinfection because the used mask lacks virucidal properties and can become an additional source of infection  The combination of antiviral and filtration properties enhances the durability and reliability of masks  thereby reducing the likelihood of crossinfection  In this review  we focus on masks  from the manufacturing stage to practical applications  and their abilities to combat COVID19  Herein  we discuss the impacts of masks on the environment  while considering safe industrial production in the future  Furthermore  we discuss available options for future research directions that do not negatively impact the environment,",

"The power of photography has been widely acknowledged, but oftentimes its impact is underestimated. Photography has the potential to capture moments and feelings in a way that words often cannot. One particular photographer who expertly demonstrates this potential is Ansel Adams, an American photographer wellknown for his black and white images of the natural world. His photographs provide a window into natures grandeur and beauty, as well as its fragility in the face of human destruction. Adams spent much of his life capturing different landscapes with his camera lensesfrom Yosemite Valley to Alaskas Glacier Bayand worked tirelessly to develop techniques that allowed him to bring out the unique details he found in each location. By using light sensitivity printing paper, he was able to achieve what many considered impossible creating detailed prints with bold contrasts between dark shadows and bright highlights without losing any detail or texture from either end of the spectrum. The result showcased Mother Natures immense power while simultaneously showing how vulnerable it can be when humans interfere recklessly with our environment. In addition to showcasing natures beauty through photography, Adams also utilized his work towards conservation efforts throughout California by advocating for protection against development projects that threatened fragile habitats across state parks like Muir Woods National Monument and Kings Canyon National Park. He used both still photos and highly produced films such as This Is The American Earth 1960 alongside other activist photographers like Eliot Porter to draw attention away from destructive human activity toward appreciation for natural wildlife habitats across North America instead. Ansel Adams photographic works are not only aesthetically pleasing but have carried substantial weight beyond simply providing visual documentation about our relationship with nature they represent so much more than just another pretty picture on Instagram or Snapchat stories they have helped shape public understanding about land ethics as critical component of environmental stewardship today over fifty years later since their creation during 1950s1970s era activism movements within California wilderness regions specifically dedicated towards preservationism,",

"Soccer is one of the most beloved and widely played sports in the world. It has been around for centuries, connecting people from different backgrounds, cultures, and countries through a common interest playing the game. Whether it be professional leagues or street soccer matches with friends, soccer can bring people together in a unique way. In recent decades there have been vast improvements to how soccer is played at both recreational and competitive levels worldwide. Professional clubs now offer various programs intended to help develop players from an early age such as youth academies which teach basic skills and tactics that allow children to become better players as they age. Societal changes over time have also helped create a shift towards more inclusive environments where anyone regardless of their background can learn how to play the sport without prejudice or discrimination  something that was not possible even just a few years ago. At its core, soccer is still very much an individuals sport though it requires teamwork within its framework it relies on each players ability to think critically tactically while making quick decisions regarding strategy during gameplay in order for their team to succeed. This makes it difficult but rewarding when done correctly  similar yet distinct from other teambased sports like basketball or American football where strategies are often determined by coaches beforehand rather than being devised by individual players onthespot during games themselves. . The essence of what makes soccer so compelling lies within each players personal style whether they choose to focus on defensive skills such as blocking shots or goalkeeping techniques attack minded approaches such as dribbling and passing proficiency or developing strategic knowledge regarding formation setups based on specific situations throughout each match  all while thinking acutely about ways they can contribute positively towards helping their teammates win games regardless of success rates achieved individually  everyone has something special they bring into every match which helps make them stronger overall. Indeed this team effort mentality combined with strong individual performances forms the backbone of any successful club,",

"PURPOSE  The use of lung ultrasound for diagnosis of COVID19 has emerged during the pandemic as a beneficial diagnostic modality due to its rapid availability  bedside use  and lack of radiation  This study aimed to determine if routine ultrasound  US  imaging of the lungs of trauma patients with COVID19 infections who undergo extended focused assessment with sonography for trauma  EFAST  correlates with computed tomography  CT  imaging and Xray findings  as previously reported in other populations  METHODS  This was a prospective  observational feasibility study performed at two level 1 trauma centers  US  CT  and Xray imaging were retrospectively reviewed by a surgical trainee and a boardcertified radiologist to determine any correlation of imaging findings in patients with active COVID19 infection  RESULTS  There were 53 patients with lung US images from EFAST available for evaluation and COVID19 testing  The overall COVID19 positivity rate was 7 5   COVID19 infection was accurately identified by one patient on US by the trainee  but there was a 15 1  falsepositive rate for infection based on the radiologist examination  CONCLUSIONS  Evaluation of the lung during EFAST cannot be used in the trauma setting to identify patients with active COVID19 infection or to stratify patients as high or low risk of infection  This is likely due to differences in lung imaging technique and the presence of concomitant thoracic injury,",

"BACKGROUND  The COVID19 pandemic  caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARSCoV2   has substantially impacted healthcare utilization worldwide  The objective of this retrospective analysis of a large hospital discharge database was to compare allcause and causespecific hospitalizations during the first six months of the pandemic in the United States with the same months in the previous four years  METHODS  Data were collected from all hospitals in the Premier Healthcare Database  PHD  and PHD Special Release reporting hospitalizations from January through July for each year from 2016 through 2020  Hospitalization trends were analyzed stratified by age group  major diagnostic categories  MDCs   and geographic region  RESULTS  The analysis included 286 hospitals from all 9 US Census divisions  The number of allcause hospitalizations per month was relatively stable from 2016 through 2019 and then fell by 21   57 281 fewer hospitalizations  between March and April 2020  particularly in hospitalizations for nonrespiratory illnesses  From April onward there was a rise in the number of monthly hospitalizations per month  Hospitalizations per month  nationally and in each Census division  decreased for 20 of 25 MDCs between March and April 2020  There was also a decrease in hospitalizations per month for all age groups between March and April 2020 with the greatest decreases in hospitalizations observed for patients 5064 and   65 years of age  CONCLUSIONS  Rates of hospitalization declined substantially during the first months of the COVID19 pandemic  suggesting delayed routine  elective  and emergency care in the United States  These lapses in care for illnesses not related to COVID19 may lead to increases in morbidity and mortality for other conditions  Thus  in the current stage of the pandemic  clinicians and publichealth officials should work  not only to prevent SARSCoV2 transmission  but also to ensure that care for nonCOVID19 conditions is not delayed,",

"The beauty of mathematics is undeniable. With mathematical principles, we can unlock the secrets of scientific progress. From developing new technologies to managing complex financial systems, mathematics has become an integral part of our daily lives. Without this knowledge, modern society would be unable to function as it does today. At its core, math is a language used to explain and understand the complexities that define our universe and everyday life. As an academic pursuit, it provides us with valuable insights into the way things work and how interrelated elements interact with each other in order to produce desired outcomes or results. Math also helps us comprehend how best to analyze data and develop models that accurately reflect reality in addition, understanding equations allows us greater insight into a range of physical phenomena from planetary orbits around stars all the way down to microscopic particle behavior on atomic scales. In essence then, mathematics brings structure and order out of chaos by allowing us to make sense out of seemingly chaotic processes or patterns. Its symbolic representation offers clarity when attempting difficult problems while providing a better means for communication between individuals who may not otherwise be able communicate effectively due their disparate backgrounds or education levels  algebraic notation can bridge those gaps Moreover, without maths fundamental tenants such as logic and abstraction whereby one can solve issues without relying on concrete evidence, much research would remain impossible as there would be no consistent framework upon which anything could be built or solved upon. All told then mathematics is absolutely essential for both personal growth  development as well as for scientific advancement at large,",

"What many people dont realize is that the sport of figure skating is more than just a beautiful art form its also an incredibly difficult and demanding athletic activity. Figure skaters must be wellcoordinated, graceful athletes who possess strength, agility, endurance and flexibility. Moreover, they need to have excellent balance and control over their bodies in order to perform the intricate choreographic moves required in competition. The complexity of figure skating begins with mastering basic skills such as jumps, spins, footwork sequences and combinations. Skaters then progress to more advanced elements such as throws and lifts which require even greater levels of physical prowess and coordination between two partnersthe base who does most of the work and the flyer who performs acrobatic feats. Even simple steps become challenging when performed on ice each movement requires careful technique that often leads to minor slips or falls due to lack of proper practice time or thinning ice caused by factors like humidity or temperature changes during competitions. Skills are not all that make up this highly competitive sport thoughit also requires strong mental focus so that skaters can stay on top while performing under immense pressure from judges during performances at major regional events across domestically or internationally. On top of this stress is added financial burden for some competitors since securing high quality training facilities along with suitable coaches for specialized techniques are very expensive outside North American countries where free public access exists. Despite these hardships however many dedicated individuals still participate in the worldwide phenomenon known as figure skating every year because theres simply no other feeling quite like performing a routine perfectly executed after months upon months spent mastering ones craftwhether it be competing professionally at international championships or merely throwing out tricks for fun at local rinks around town .

"In recent years, the rise of renewable energy sources has been increasingly debated in American homes and workplaces. With the increase in global temperatures and an increasing awareness for sustainable living practices, many individuals are beginning to consider how they can incorporate renewable energy into their lives. While some may simply opt to install solar panels onto their roofs or purchase electric vehicles, other more ambitious individuals seek to power entire households with renewable energy sources such as wind turbines and geothermal heat pumps. When done correctly, utilizing these alternative energy systems can provide significant savings on electricity bills while also having a positive impact on the environment. The installation of a homebased renewable energy system is no easy task however, it does have its rewards when completed successfully. For starters, homeowners benefit from lower electricity costs due to reduced reliance on griddependent power sources such as coal or natural gas plants. Further incentive comes with eligible tax credits offered by both state and federal governments that further reduce financial strain associated with installing such equipment while also providing potential future cost savings over time when compared against traditional utility providers prices increases over time. In addition to cost savings, there are environmental benefits associated with powering ones home via clean green resources like wind turbines or geothermal heat pumps which help reduce carbon emissions leading up toward overall sustainability goals. This type of setup allows those interested in being conscious about their daily usage choices without sacrificing comfortas long as proper engineering advice is taken during planning stagesin order to obtain optimal performance from the chosen systems. . Although transitioning away from traditional fossil fuel based solutions towards cleaner alternatives may seem daunting at first glance hopefully this overview provides insight into why todays homeowner should seriously consider investing in a homebased renewable energy system for greater economic stability along with improved environmental conservation activities that will ultimately lead us all toward a healthier future lifestyle for our communities at large worldwide,",
"The use of face masks outside the health care facility dates back a century ago  However  face masks use noticeably soared due to the COVID19  Coronavirus disease 2019  pandemic  As a result  an unprecedented influx of discarded face masks is ending up in the environment  This review paper delves into face masks in the environment using the DPSIR  driving forces  pressures  states  impacts  and responses  framework to simplify and communicate the environmental indicators  Firstly  the historical  and briefly the economic trajectory of face masks are discussed  Secondly  the main driving forces of face masks use with an emphasis on public health are explored  Then  the pressures exerted by efforts to fulfill the human needs  driving forces  are explored  In turn  the state of the environment due to the influx of masks along with the impacts are examined  Furthermore  the upstream  and downstream societal responses to mitigate the environmental damages of the driving forces  pressures  states  and impacts are reviewed  In summary  it has been shown from this review that the COVID19 pandemic has been causing a surge in face mask usage  which translates to face masks pollution in both terrestrial and aquatic environments  This implies proper usage and disposal of face masks is paramount to the quality of human health and the environment  respectively  Moreover  further research on ecofriendly face masks is indispensable to mitigating the environmental damages occurring due to the mass use of surgical masks worldwide,",

"BACKGROUND  There have been several destructive pandemic diseases in the human history  Since these pandemic diseases spread through humantohuman infection  a number of nonpharmacological policies has been enforced until an effective vaccine has been developed  In addition  even though a vaccine has been developed  due to the challenges in the production and distribution of the vaccine  the authorities have to optimize the vaccination policies based on the priorities  Considering all these facts  a comprehensive but simple parametric model enriched with the pharmacological and nonpharmacological policies has been proposed in this study to analyse and predict the future pandemic casualties  METHOD  This paper develops a priority and age specific vaccination policy and modifies the nonpharmacological policies including the curfews  lockdowns  and restrictions  These policies are incorporated with the susceptible  suspicious  infected  hospitalized  intensive care  intubated  recovered  and death submodels  The resulting model is parameterizable by the available data where a recursive least squares algorithm with the inequality constraints optimizes the unknown parameters  The inequality constraints ensure that the structural requirements are satisfied and the parameter weights are distributed proportionally  RESULTS  The results exhibit a distinctive third peak in the casualties occurring in 40 days and confirm that the intensive care  intubated  and death casualties converge to zero faster than the susceptible  suspicious  and infected casualties with the priority and age specific vaccination policy  The model also estimates that removing the curfews on the weekends and holidays cause more casualties than lifting the restrictions on the people with the chronic diseases and age over 65  CONCLUSION  Sophisticated parametric models equipped with the pharmacological and nonpharmacological policies can predict the future pandemic casualties for various cases,",

"As the world changes and technology advances, the importance of environmental sustainability is growing more apparent. As individuals, we can all make a difference in promoting sustainable practices that minimize our impact on the environment. One way to do this is by reducing food waste through composting practices. Composting harnesses organic materials  food scraps, yard trimmings, paper products  and transforms them into nutrientrich soil which can be used for gardening or landscaping projects. By diverting these materials from landfills where they produce methane gas a major contributor to climate change, we can contribute significantly to creating a healthier planet while also saving money by reducing our trash bills. In addition to its environmental benefits, composting teaches us about natures cycles and helps promote an understanding of how fragile ecosystems work together in harmony. Individuals who are interested in starting their own compost pile should first determine whether their municipality offers any type of curbside collection program or other local services related to composting if not available, there are many different DIY methods that can be employed at home with minimal effort and resources needed. If you choose to build your own outdoor composter at home, start by researching what types of containers will work best for your particular needs for example metal bins with tight fitting lids may keep pests away but may not provide adequate drainage like wooden bins would. Next decide what kind of material you would likebe able to use as browns carbon such as straw hay or fallen leaves and greens nitrogen such as grass clippings or kitchen scraps . Finally select a location in direct sunlight within close proximity of water source so it is easy access when it requires moisture during hot summer months.

"The beauty of math is that it unifies all areas of human inquiry. From the most abstract formulae to humble addition and subtraction, mathematics underpins almost every aspect of everyday life. No matter what subject one studies or where they live, an understanding of basic math concepts is essential. This essay will explore why math matters in our lives and how its applications are far-reaching and incredible. Mathematicians have explored number theory for thousands of years with remarkable results from formulas for predicting astronomical events to discoveries about prime numbers that remain unsolved riddles today. Michelangelo's famous frescoes on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel are testament to this legacy as his work incorporates mathematical shapes like circles and squares into a sophisticated composition that has stood the test of time. Indeed, many great works throughout history owe their success partly to mathematic principles behind them. But beyond aesthetics, mathematics plays an important role in helping us understand the world around us  from computing probabilities in medicine through to helping forecast weather patterns using big data analysis techniques borrowed from statistics. The sheer range and complexity of problems tackled by mathematicians demonstrate just how versatile this field can be when applied correctly  making it indispensable across many sectors like science, engineering, finance, technology etcetera. And while much progress has been made over centuries e.g., calculus, new frontiers await as we continue exploring unknown domains likely involving artificial intelligence or machine learning algorithms powered by neural networks modelled after biological systems eerily reminiscent yet dissimilar enough so that no two solutions would ever be quite identical. Finally come back around full circle  math's also gives us tools which help build bridges between different cultural traditions whether its collaborating with another team member halfway across the globe via video conferencing software designed using physics equations or simply communicating ideas more effectively thanks to shared vocabulary derived from arithmetic fundamentals such as algebraic symbols used in complex graphs there could,",

"When it comes to achieving success in school, time management is key. Many high school and college students struggle with managing their time effectively, leading to missed deadlines, incomplete assignments, and lower grades than they could have attained. In order to make sure this doesnt happen, there are a few simple strategies that any student can use to maximize their productivity while studying. First of all, creating a schedule is essential for good time management. It should be made the night before or at least the morning of the day ahead so that you know exactly what tasks need doing each day and when they need completing by. This will allow you to plan your study sessions around other activities accordingly without feeling overwhelmed or having too little time each day for everything that needs done. Another tip for effective time management is removing distractions from your workspace or study area such as phones and music players as these can easily draw away attention from working successfully on an assignment or studying for a test. Disabling notifications on social media apps may also help since one notification can often lead down a rabbit hole of procrastination  leaving much less done than anticipated. Lastly but certainly not least important is taking regular breaks throughout long periods of work which helps refresh both mind and body allowing us to stay focused longer instead of burning out quickly over extended hours spent at our desks alone. . . Overall while it seems like quite a daunting task at first glance  proper time management is something anyone can master with practice making sure we get good rest along with staying organized every step inbetween leads us towards better results academically  professionally alike no matter what field we end up pursuing after our schooling years come to an end,",

"OBJECTIVE  To compare the incidence of middle ear effusion  MEE  at the time of bilateral tympanostomy tube insertion  BTI  for recurrent acute otitis media  rAOM  patients initially seen inoffice or via telehealth  METHODS  After obtaining IRB approval from Nationwide Children s Hospital  a total of 524 patients evaluated for rAOM were retrospectively reviewed after being divided into two cohorts  those seen via a telehealth visit from April to June of 2020  n   140   and those seen via an inperson visit from April to June of 2019  n   384   Recommendation for BTI was captured for each patient following their visit  Clinical characteristics documented at the time of the visit  such as history of intramuscular  IM  antibiotic use and hearing or speech concerns were also captured to determine whether both telehealth and inperson cohorts were similar in clinical presentation  For BTI patients  the presence or absence of MEE in either ear at the time of BTI was recorded  Patients with cleft palate or prior BTI were excluded  RESULTS  51 43   72 140  of patients in the telehealth cohort were recommended for BTI  Of those recommended  87 50   63 72  underwent BTI  Of these  31 75   20 63  had a MEE at the time of BTI  In the inoffice cohort  69 01   265 384  of patients were recommended for BTI  Of those recommended  92 83   246 265  underwent BTI  Of these  69 92   172 246  had a MEE at the time of BTI  CONCLUSION  There were significantly less middle ear effusions in the telehealth cohort compared to the inoffice cohort  p  0 0001   It is well understood that telehealth is limited in its physical exam capabilities  It is possible that the use of telehealth for the surgical management of rAOM may lead to more procedures on patients without MEE,",

"The internet has revolutionized the way people learn, work and interact with one another. This technology has become an integral part of our lives and it is important to understand how it can be used in education. Online learning is becoming increasingly popular as more students have access to a computer, the internet, and other technologies needed for studying. One of the major benefits of online learning is its flexibility  students can structure their studies around their existing commitments such as work or family life. Also, since there are no physical classes or lectures to attend, students have more control over when they study as well as where they do so they also dont need to worry about getting to campus on time or finding parking spots Furthermore, online courses often allow collaboration between peers which can encourage robust discussion that would not occur in a traditional classroom setting. Another benefit of online learning is affordability  many universities offer discounts for online courses due to lower costs associated with providing them. Additionally, textbooks may cost less than hard copies from a local bookstore or even free if available electronically. Plus some course materials such as lecture notes may be provided by professors at no additional cost through platforms like Blackboard or Canvas meaning you dont need to purchase expensive books every semester. . Further advantages include being able engage with diverse perspectives from all over the world rather than just those present within your particular geographic location plus having easier access to experts in any field that could help further your understanding and knowledge base on topics related directly or indirectly towards your studies Of course these advantages should always be balanced against potential disadvantages like communication difficulties posed by virtual environments compared with facetoface interactions but overall digital pedagogies provide greater opportunities for engagement especially amongst marginalized groups who historically had limited access educational resources due systemic inequity embedded into traditional postsecondary institutions. .

"OBJECTIVE  Stress among family members of hospitalised intensive care unit patients may be amplified in the context of a global pandemic and strict visitor restrictions  A nurse family liaison role in the COVID19 units was implemented to serve as a connection between the care team and a designated family member  Our objective was to describe the experience of a nurse family liaison role implemented during the COVID19 pandemic from the perspective of nurses who functioned in the liaison role and intensive care nurses who worked with the liaisons  RESEARCH METHOD DESIGN  This was a qualitative study using thematic analysis involving a onetime semistructured interview  A convenience sample of nurses were invited to participate  The analytic approach involved  1  becoming familiar with the data   2  finding meaning in the data   3  organising meaningful statements into patterns to generate themes  SETTING PARTICIPANTS  Nurses who functioned in the liaison role and intensive care nurses who worked with the liaisons in an adult academic health center in the Midwest United States  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE  To describe the psychosocial experience of nurse family liaison role implementation  FINDINGS  The sample  n   11  mean age was 36 years  range 2649  and the majority were female  n   10  90    White nonHispanic  n   11  100    Bachelor prepared  n   10  90    and had an average of 10 years of experience as a nurse  range 425   The major themes identified by participants were living in a pandemic  establishing the role and workflow and experiencing human connection  CONCLUSION  Hospital organisations should consider how they can provide familycentred care  specifically within the context of a global crisis such as a pandemic  Participant descriptions of the role indicate that liaison implementation alleviated nurse moral distress and fostered development of close family connections  Findings can help inform implementation of similar roles in hospital settings,",

"The COVID19 pandemic has produced alterations in the behaviour and psychological health of people  who have had to learn living under uncertain circumstances escaping their control  This situation has been aggravated in those countries applying strict home confinement rules to try bending their epidemic curve  This is the case of Spain  where the stringent lockdown period was extended over three months  This study aimed at proving a research hypothesis whereby living close to Green Infrastructure  GI  during the confinement period was beneficial for mental health  To this end  La Palma  Canary Islands  and Zaragoza  Peninsular Spain  were taken as case studies  since both locations distributed a questionnaire to address citizenry s selfreported mental health under strict lockdown conditions  A spatial statistical analysis of the responses collected by these questionnaires revealed that variables such as stress  anger  medication use  alcohol consumption or visits to the doctor significantly decreased if citizens were close to GI  whereas people having very high expectations of enjoying the city after the confinement were positively correlated to proximity of green areas  Although these outcomes are limited by the inferential capacity of correlation analysis  they point out to a sense of relief derived from having visual contact with vegetated landscapes and feeling stimulated about using them for recreation  aesthetical or sporting purposes  The joint consideration of these psychological gains with the social and environmental benefits provided by GI emphasizes the importance of approaching urban regeneration through the design and implementation of interconnected green spaces,",

"The Benefits of Taking a Gap Year After High School Graduation. Graduating high school is an accomplishment that many students are proud of and look forward to, but with it comes the decision about what direction to take next. Some may decide college is right for them while others may pursue career paths. One overlooked option that many young adults should consider taking advantage of is taking a gap year after graduating high school. A gap year offers plenty of benefits and can even lead to better success in the future. One benefit of taking a gap year before heading off to college or beginning a new job is gaining more experience outside of academics. Many students spend their entire high school careers focused on learning, so having some time away from class allows people to gain real world skills such as working with different kinds of people and developing communication abilities all these will come in handy when attending university or entering into the workforce. Another great benefit from taking this type of break from studies is being able to explore interests without feeling pressure from parents or peers its important for individuals who plan on going into higher education or any field to understand what they actually enjoy doing beyond passing tests or getting good grades which could be anything ranging from volunteering at local organizations, traveling internationally, interning in their desired industry etc. These activities dont just help build character but also offer invaluable lessons related directly back towards future goals too. . Moreover, gap years provide newfound freedom that can result in significant development both personally and professionally no matter how much independence teens may claim during their teenage years, nothing quite compares with having the autonomy to live your life however you want once all obligations like graduation are out of the way theres no course syllabus dictating ones daytoday activities during this time period either This sense liberation leads onto something else as well discovering yourself on your own terms without relying solely upon other peoples opinionsadvicesomething,",

"Growing up in a small town has its advantages and disadvantages. Although some may argue that being raised in an urban setting is more beneficial, rural living can provide invaluable experiences to those fortunate enough to be part of it. For one thing, the community atmosphere in a small town creates strong bonds between neighbors and encourages everyone to look out for one another. With fewer distractions like restaurants or movie theaters, people engage with each other more often. This allows individuals to get to know their neighbors on a personal level instead of just seeing them as strangers passing by outside your window every day. As children grow up they become familiar with many members of the community who become almost like extended family members this familiarity helps create meaningful relationships within the towns citizens and strengthens their bond with each other over time. Another advantage of growing up in a small town is access to nature and outdoor activities such as camping, fishing, hunting, hiking or simply walking around enjoying the peace away from busy city life. Rural living provides ample opportunity for children and adults alike to explore nature and experience all its wonders firsthand without having to travel very far from home. Moreover, when you live closer proximity than cities do not need traffic or long commutes which gives us extra time we can use for leisure activities  such as playing sports outdoors  or spending quality time with friends and family at home these are moments that would otherwise be lost if we lived somewhere else where transportation was required much longer timespans . On the flip side there are also drawbacks associated with growing up in a small town including limited entertainment options especially comparedto bigger cities  this could mean less places available have fun nights out dancing clubs participating cultural events etc while there still plenty things can do spend evenings weekends usually restricted locations within close range rather than say going into larger metropolis exploring variety venues few hours drive away Nonetheless even big towns malls amusement parks cinemas require car trip nowadays so end result remains same rural communities However,",

We are all familiar with the advantages that technology providesaccess to information, communication and entertainment at our fingertipsbut what about the potential drawbacks In particular, this essay will explore the implications of excessive reliance on digital media for young peoples social development. In a society where much of human interaction occurs over virtual platforms like Facebook and Instagram rather than in person, there is an undeniable risk of disconnection from reality. This can lead to reduced selfesteem as users become increasingly focused on comparing themselves against others seemingly perfect online personas. Additionally, research suggests heavy use of digital media has been linked to feelings of depression and anxiety due to increased exposure to cyberbullying and other forms of negative reinforcement through peer comparison. Furthermore, physical contact is essential for positive socialization during childhood development yet activities such as video gaming and streaming TV shows often lead young people towards solitary pursuits instead. As a result they may miss out on vital opportunities for developing interpersonal skills through facetoface interactions or participating in sports or outdoor activities with peers their own age. Such deficits can have far reaching effects throughout later life including difficulty forming meaningful relationships or finding suitable employment due to limited networking contacts derived from real world experiences. It would be wrong however not to recognize the potentially beneficial role that technology plays in connecting us across vast distances using instant messaging services or providing educational resources not available anywhere else so easily accessed online such as interactive learning programs or webinars studying various topics from international locations without ever having leave home Nevertheless if these aspects are allowed overshadow authentic personal connections then we risk creating generations who lack fundamental relationship building skills necessary for successful integration into society beyond school years ahead them  something which could present more serious repercussions than any one individual might imagine playing games phones computers every waking hour day after day week year upon year. .

"SARSCoV2  the causative agent for COVID19  an ongoing pandemic  engages the ACE2 receptor to enter the host cell through S protein priming by a serine protease  TMPRSS2  Variation in the TMPRSS2 gene may account for the disparity in disease susceptibility between populations  Therefore  in the present study  we have used nextgeneration sequencing  NGS  data of world populations from 393 individuals and analyzed the TMPRSS2 gene using a haplotypebased approach with a major focus on South Asia to study its phylogenetic structure and their haplotype sharing among various populations worldwide  Our analysis of phylogenetic relatedness showed a closer affinity of South Asians with the West Eurasian populations therefore  host disease susceptibility and severity particularly in the context of TMPRSS2 will be more akin to West Eurasian instead of East Eurasian  This is in contrast to our prior study on the ACE2 gene which shows South Asian haplotypes have a strong affinity towards West Eurasians  Thus ACE2 and TMPRSS2 have an antagonistic genetic relatedness among South Asians  Considering the significance of the TMPRSS2 gene in the SARSCoV2 pathogenicity  COVID19 infection and intensity trends could be directly associated with increased expression therefore  we have also tested the SNPs frequencies of this gene among various Indian state populations with respect to the case fatality rate  CFR   Interestingly  we found a significant positive association between the rs2070788 SNP  G Allele  and the CFR among Indian populations  Further our cis eQTL analysis of rs2070788 shows that the GG genotype of the rs2070788 tends to have a significantly higher expression of TMPRSS2 gene in the lung compared to the AG and AA genotypes thus validating the previous observation and therefore it might play a vital part in determining differential disease vulnerability  We trust that this information will be useful in understanding the role of the TMPRSS2 variant in COVID19 susceptibility and using it as a biomarker may help to predict populations at risk,",

"A growing trend in society today is the integration of modern technology into the classroom. The utilization of various digital tools and technological resources can be an incredibly valuable educational asset, but it also presents several unique challenges that must be addressed to ensure effective implementation. One major challenge presented by implementing technology into school curricula is incorporating it without disrupting traditional teaching methods. Although computers and other forms of technology are becoming more commonplace in classrooms, many teachers remain hesitant to integrate them because they fear that their students will become distracted from course material by playing video games or engaging in other activities unrelated to learning. To combat this problem, educators should begin by introducing a few simple technological concepts such as using tablets for notetaking or searching the internet for research materials rather than trying to implement complex technologies all at once. Additionally, there should be clear rules about usage specific to each class so that students understand which activities are conducive to learning and which ones are not allowed during instruction time. In addition to finding ways around distracting use of devices, another common challenge when introducing modern technology into classrooms is funding its purchase and upkeep costs. It can often cost a significant amount of money for schools  especially those with limited budgets  to acquire enough uptodate equipment needed for sufficient classroom integration and maintenance expenses can add up quickly if machines arent properly taken care of throughout their lifespans. To help remedy this issue, administrators may need explore alternate options such as renting tools on an as needed basis or seeking out grants specifically designed for purchasing new educational technologies. Furthermore, having a designated IT staff member who can troubleshoot any technical problems that arise would likely provide added assistance both financially and logistically speaking when integrating more advanced gadgets into any given curriculum. . The use of computer systems and related technologies within academic settings has made considerable progress over recent years however many roadblocks still exist before widespread adoption becomes feasible across different age groups nationwide .

"The use of blockchain technology in the real estate industry has been gaining traction as a way to streamline and secure transactions. In recent years, this technology has been increasingly used for purchasing, selling, and leasing property due to its encrypted ledger system. This essay will focus on how blockchain is revolutionizing the real estate sector by providing an efficient and safe way to conduct business. Blockchain offers tremendous potential when it comes to making real estate transactions more efficient and secure. By using decentralized digital ledgers, each transaction can be securely recorded without requiring a central authority such as a bank or government agency to approve or reject them. The data stored in these ledgers is immutable which means that no one party can change itthe information remains valid forever once updated onto the chain. Furthermore, since all parties involved in a given transaction have access to view its details at any time during the deals lifespan, trust between buyers and sellers is increased substantially. In addition to improved security measures provided by blockchain technology, there are several other advantages associated with its use in the real estate sector. For instance, utilizing smart contracts helps expedite deals significantly rather than relying on tedious paperworkbased legal processes lasting weeks or months at a time or even longer, contracts are triggered automatically when certain predetermined conditions are met within seconds or minutes instead  saving both parties valuable time throughout each step of negotiations . Additionally , because every transaction is recorded on an immutable ledger , fraud prevention rates are much higher compared traditional methods where fraudulent activity may go unnoticed until long after deals have been finalized . Finally , while blockchain presents numerous opportunities for those participating within the realm of property investment , it also carries some risks including cyber vulnerabilities that could potentially put confidential personal information at risk if not properly secured . Therefore , special attention should be paid towards safeguarding against hackers attempting malicious activities before implementing any kind of distributed ledger system across an organizations operations . With that said however , precautions like mult,",

"Over the years, technology has revolutionized the way we live and work. For many of us, this transformation can be seen in the rise of smartphones, social media platforms, and other digital devices that have become so indispensable for modern life. But one area where technology has had an especially profound impact is on the art of photography. Since its origins in 1839 with French artist Louis Daguerres invention of daguerreotype processthe worlds first practical form of photographythe medium has come a long way. In fact, today photographers are able to control not just how they capture their images but also more precisely edit them after theyre taken with various software programs like Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop Elements. Consequently, what was once considered a relatively basic craft now requires knowledge and practice to master it fully knowing which lenses to use when shooting portraits or landscapes is only part of the equation since theres a whole realm dedicated to editing photos afterwards as well. Furthermore, advances in camera phone technology mean that almost anyone can take decent photographs without having to invest in expensive hardware or software solutions all you need nowadays is your smartphone This democratization effect clearly shows just how far digital photography has come over time and why even professional photographers must adapt quickly if they want stay current with new trends  something that may involve learning about photo manipulation techniques suchas HDR High Dynamic Range processing or achieving unique effects through computergenerated filters like those found on Instagram. In conclusion, its hard deny that digital cameras coupled with imageediting programs have changed not just how people record their memories but also how photographers create special effects from scratch  making modern day photography both excitingly accessible yet technically complicated at the same time,",

NBA superstars like Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant and LeBron James have become iconic for not only their athletic abilities but also for their commitment to excellence through hard work and dedication. Michael Jordan once said The highest compliment that you can pay me is to say that I worked hard every day  a statement that sums up his uncompromising attitude towards achieving greatness. He was relentless in pushing himself and his teammates beyond what they thought was possible by always demanding better results both on and off the court  an approach which earned him six championships with the Chicago Bulls as well as numerous individual awards over his illustrious career. Similarly, Kobe Bryant wasnt afraid to put forth maximum effort every game even if it cost him wins or personal accolades, citing team success as being paramount over any individual achievement he could acquire himself. His Mamba mentality has since been adopted by many aspiring athletes looking to emulate his drive and ambition,. LeBron James is another example of how putting forth your best efforts can lead to incredible success. Considered one of the greatest players ever, LeBrons focus on working smarter rather than harder has allowed him achieve something even greater transforming entire communities across America with social initiatives such as The Promise Land Family Center which provide resources for underprivileged youth growing up without access or opportunity available elsewhere due this selfless dedicationproviding them guidance wherever needed whether educationally or financially. In conclusion, while having exceptional physical talents may help get you into professional basketball  staying there requires much more than natural ability alone commitment is key Players like,",

"We tend to think of mathematics as the study of numbers, equations, and formulas. But in reality, math is much more than that its an integral part of our everyday lives. Math isnt just about crunching numbers or solving equations it affects every aspect of our lives from how we cook food to how we travel from place to placemath is everywhere. In the kitchen, math plays a key role in making sure recipes turn out correctly. From measuring ingredients to understanding proportions and ratios, a working knowledge of basic mathematical concepts makes cooking easier and tastier. Understanding fractions can help you make sense of ingredient measurements like 14 cup sugar or 34 teaspoon salt while also enabling you create complex culinary dishes with ease. And if you ever want to multiply or divide a recipe for bigger or smaller batches No problemall you need is some simple arithmetic. Of course, even when we leave the kitchen mathematics come into play. Whether its converting miles per hour into kilometers per hour on your cars speedometer or balancing your checkbook after shopping at the grocery store math helps us navigate both large and small life decisions throughout our daytoday lives without us even realizing it. . It may seem mundane but math really does make all areas of life easier once one understands basic principles such as addition, subtraction multiplication and division . Even something seemingly complicated like trigonometry are not impossible concepts  they can be broken down step by step until one fully comprehends what each term means .

"The field of mathematics is an important part of the foundation for much of human progress. It has been used throughout history to unlock new insights, solve problems, and make calculations that would have been impossible without it. From the ancient Egyptians counting with their hands to modernday computers making complex calculations in a fraction of a second, mathematical knowledge and applications have enabled us to stretch our boundaries and explore new realms. Mathematics is so pervasive that it can be found everywhere from building construction plans, engineering projects, consumer pricing models, scientific formulas all the way down to simple everyday activities like cooking recipes or balancing checkbooks. Its use allows us to gain insight into patterns not easily visible on first glancesuch as predicting future trends in stock markets or forecasting weather patterns over timeand brings structure and order out of chaos. Without mathematics we would struggle to get by on some basic tasks such as calculating discounts at stores or even telling the time Mathematics also contributes heavily to other fields like economics and finance where equations are used for predictive modeling purposes in order for companies or governments to plan ahead financially more accurately. In addition math helps explain phenomenon like gravity which underlies many physical events seen throughout our universe including planetary motion and climate change here on earth as well as being vital towards astronomical observations facilitating navigation aids such satellites enabling GPS tracking systems across multiple devices worldwide today Math has thus become increasingly integral within technology itself too since computer algorithms rely heavily upon its concepts  principles when executing tasks efficiently  effectively  whether this be through data analysis machine learning artificial intelligence etcetera Finally lets not forget medical research either particularly concerning statistical methods helping scientists understand diseases better develop treatments accordingly improve patient outcomes statistics help ensure clinical trials go smoothly provide reliable results track changes over time monitor patients post treatment etcetera again leading towards improved healthcare provisioning overall.

"BACKGROUND  During the COVID19 pandemic  the UK government implemented a series of guidelines  rules  and restrictions to change citizens  behaviour to tackle the spread of the virus  such as the promotion of face masks and the imposition of lockdown stayathome orders  The success of such measures requires active cooperation on the part of citizens  but compliance was not complete  Detailed research is required on the factors that aided or hindered compliance with these measures  METHODS  To understand the facilitators and barriers to compliance with COVID19 guidelines  we used structural topic modelling  a text mining technique  to extract themes from over 26 000 freetext survey responses from 17 500 UK adults  collected between 17 November and 23 December 2020  RESULTS  The main factors facilitating compliance were desires to reduce risk to oneself and one s family and friends and to  a lesser extent  the general public  Also of importance were a desire to return to normality  the availability of activities and technological means to contact family and friends  and the ability to work from home  Identified barriers were difficulties maintaining social distancing in public  due to the actions of other people or environmental constraints   the need to provide or receive support from family and friends  social isolation  missing loved ones  and mental health impacts  perceiving the risks as low  social pressure to not comply  and difficulties understanding and keep abreast of changing rules  Several of the barriers and facilitators raised were related to participant characteristics  Notably  women were more likely to discuss needing to provide or receive mental health support from friends and family  CONCLUSION  The results demonstrated an array of factors contributed to compliance with guidelines  Of particular policy importance  the results suggest that government communication that emphasizes the potential risks of the virus and provides simple  consistent guidance on how to reduce the spread of the virus would improve compliance with preventive behaviours as COVID19 continues and for future pandemics,",

"INTRODUCTION  360 degrees Virtual Reality  VR  is possibly produced and sufficiently effective as a consumerfriendly VR learning medium  Therefore  it is also expected to be useful in the dental practice field  as a selflearning medium for nonfacetoface skill training during the ongoing pandemic  COVID19   Accordingly  this study was conducted to assess 360 degrees VR selflearning media for a periodontal instrument operation  MATERIALS AND METHODS  We recruited 30 participants who had never experienced instrument training  We offered basic education and initial assessment  IA   then divided them into three groups  1  PAPER  trained only with paper handouts  2  2D  trained with 2D video  3  VR  trained with 360 degrees VR  Each group performed selflearning and midterm assessment  MA   Subjects then implemented home selflearning with the same media for one week  which was then followed by a final assessment  FA   RESULT  Analysis of IAtoFA improvement scores showed that VR and 2D video were significantly higher than the PAPER groups  Meanwhile  analysis of MAtoFA improvement scores showed that only VR was substantially higher than the PAPER group  Although VR and 2D video groups were not considerably different  VR scores were numerically higher than 2D video in all improvement score analyses  DISCUSSION  Both 2D video and 360 degrees VR training were helpful to participants for an effective selflearning and also had good portability and accessibility as onlinebased learning methods  360 degrees VR showed higher learning efficiency than regular 2D video  possibly due to its autonomy  360 degrees visual information  and physical and immersive characteristics  which positively affected selftraining  CONCLUSION  Our findings showed the potential of 360 degrees VR learning media and further  suggest its usefulness as a novel selflearning method in future dental education,",

"From the time of its inception, mathematics has been one of mankinds most powerful tools in understanding and manipulating our environment. Whether it be measuring distances or predicting future events or providing solutions to problems, mathematics has had a profound effect on shaping human civilization. One can see evidence of mathematical applications as early humans developed ways to track the stars for navigation and measure fields using primitive geometry. The development of number systems, algebraic manipulation, and even abstract concepts such as proof all occurred gradually over thousands of years through trialanderror experimentation. This process eventually led to the advancement of calculus which revolutionized science by allowing us to calculate rates at which changes occur in nature. With this newfound understanding humanity was able to make great technological leaps such as creating accurate maps that allowed exploration beyond known boundaries and accurately predicting weather patterns that enabled successful farming techniques from ancient times until now. Of course, it wasnt just technology that benefited from math but also art forms as well Through complex calculations mathematicians were able to create beautiful pieces like Pascals triangle or explore varied theories such as fractal geometry which inspired works like M C Eschers Drawing Hands painting series that captivate audiences around the world today with their intricate patterns and symmetries found only within mathematical formulas. . The possibilities are almost endless when considering how far mathematics have taken us throughout history however, we must acknowledge our current limitations too  although computers have made many tasks faster they cannot replace intuition nor solve all problems without certain assumptions  something only people can provide for example basic morality. Nonetheless we are constantly pushing ourselves forward thanks largely in part due to advances in the field of mathematics From managing resources more effectively through game theory models or improving communication networks with AI algorithms there is no denying how useful it is for helping humanity progress further into tomorrow.,",

"The importance of happiness in the modern world cannot be overstated. In a time where people are busier than ever, and technology threatens to replace human interaction with impersonal devices, the need for joy and satisfaction is greater than ever before. As such, it is essential that individuals make an effort to not only strive for maximum productivity but also take steps towards cultivating true contentment in their lives. Its easy to get caught up in a cycle of stress working hard on tasks at hand with little regard for our own mental wellbeing. We can become so focused on completing tasks that we forget about taking care of ourselves  something which generally leads to burn out or dissatisfaction down the line. Although ambition has its merits and should certainly be cultivated, its important that we remember that theres more to life than just work and responsibilities sometimes taking a break from those obligations is necessary if we want to maintain healthy levels of happiness throughout our lives. There are many different ways that one could pursue happiness depending on personal preference or lifestyle choices some may find solace in art or literature while others might prefer activities like yoga or meditation as methods of relaxation and selfcare. Engaging in hobbies can also help us restore balance between intellectual stimulation like studying and leisurely pursuits such as playing sports. By creating space within your daily schedule for things you enjoy doing even if they dont necessarily lead directly towards career success, it allows us all create moments when were truly able to appreciate life without feeling overwhelmed by additional pressures looming over us constantly demanding attention. . Finally, seeking out meaningful relationships with other people is another way one could pursue joyousness within hisher daytoday existence by surrounding themselves with individuals who bring genuine fulfillment into their lives through companionship rather than just distraction from responsibility which usually dissipates once the activity ends leaving emptiness behind again instead of lasting satisfaction .

"Do people really need to own cars in the modern age With the advent of new technologies such as ridesharing services, electric vehicles, and public transportation becoming more accessible than ever before, this is a question that has been posed recently. It seems that for some people, owning a car might be an unnecessary expense when other options exist. However upon closer examination it becomes clear that car ownership still remains a crucial part of life in many parts of the world and should not be completely discounted. First and foremost, cars are essential for those living in rural areas with limited access to public transit or other forms of transportation. Automobiles provide freedom to get around quickly without having to depend on others for rides or waiting for infrequent buses or trains  something that can be invaluable especially if one is trying to commute from their home out into larger cities regularly. In addition, there may be less expensive options available but they come with trade offs bicycles require extensive skill and sometimes equipment while electric scooters are often too slow over longer distances making them impractical for many users needs. Cars also provide added security since drivers know exactly whos behind the wheel and dont have to worry about being taken advantage of by strangers offering rides via online apps like Uber or Lyft which could easily become dangerous situations depending on the night time crowd at any given location. Secondly, automobiles remain important due to their convenience factor  especially when compared against mass transit systems like buses where riders must adhere strictly to predetermined timetables or else risk missing their ride entirely Cars offer flexibility allowing owners control over where they go when they want without needing any outside help this allows them much greater autonomy than what would otherwise be possible using alternative modes of transportations such as taxis which cost considerably more money on average due mainly because drivers have overhead costs related things like gas prices  vehicle maintenance fees etc. Not only do cars enable individuals move effortlessly between places but also create opportunities explore different routes  paths enabling further exploration,",

"As technology advances and the digital age progresses, it is becoming more commonplace for people to rely on computers to take care of mundane tasks. This can be seen in the math and science classrooms of today, where students are using calculators and software programs to help them with their work. While this approach simplifies many mathematical concepts, it detracts from the joy of problem-solving that comes with doing mathematics by hand. Math is a subject that requires critical thinking and a logical approach two skills that you cannot simulate through modern computing devices. By relying solely on machines to do your calculations for you, you will miss out on learning how various algorithms work and exploring ways of tackling problems in different ways than those proposed by textbooks or programming languages. You should use technology as an aid rather than as a crutch don't let it serve as an excuse not to think deeply about problems. Having said that, computers have made certain parts of math easier they can simplify tedious computations such as long division or multiplying large numbers together quickly with minimal effort from the user. This makes them invaluable tools when attempting ambitious projects such as designing complicated equations or creating graphs for data analysis purposes  something which would be practically impossible without access to specialized software packages like MATLAB or Wolfram Alpha. Furthermore, some fields like calculus use imaginary numbers which require complex computations even if done manually in these cases a calculator would be highly advantageous compared to doing everything by hand since its results may be hard if at all possible for humans alone to calculate accurately within reasonable timeframes given their limited memory capacity  processing speed compared with modern electronics e.g., laptops.

"BACKGROUND  Despite the increasing numbers of female medical students  surgery remains maledominated  PURPOSE  To highlight the principal career obstacles experienced by aspiring female surgeons  METHODS  A narrative review of literature on the position and career barriers of female surgeons has been conducted  using the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases  MAIN FINDINGS  Implicit and even explicit biases against female surgeons remain prevalent  negatively impacting their training performance and overall professional trajectory  Female surgeons are globally underrepresented in leadership positions and senior academic rankings  especially that of a full professor  They feel hampered by lack of effective mentorship  whose value for a successful career has been acknowledged by all medical students  surgeons and surgical leaders  Their worklife imbalance is sometimes expressed as lower likelihood than their male contemporaries of getting married or having children and may be attributed to their conventional association with the role of caretaker  their personal desire to accommodate occupational and family duties and the inadequate implementation of parental leave and childcare policies  Female surgeons   infertility  may be further explained by direct and indirect pregnancyrelated difficulties  Female surgeons are also financially undercompensated compared to their male contemporaries  Finally  specialtyspecific challenges should not be overlooked  CONCLUSIONS  While encouraging steps have been made  women in surgery feel still hindered by various obstacles  The qualitative  interviewbased nature of current literature requires more meticulous studies on these barriers with a more quantitative and objective approach  Attenuation of gender imbalance in surgical specialties requires further changes in mentality and more targeted modifications in relevant policies,",

"The debate about whether or not teenagers should be allowed to have a smartphone is one that has been ongoing for many years. From the perspective of both parents and teens, this is an important topic as it can affect their safety, privacy, academic performance, and mental health. On the positive side, smartphones allow teenagers to stay in touch with family and friends easily through messaging apps like WhatsApp or FaceTime. They also let them access educational resources such as online courses or ebooks which can help improve their academic grades if used properly. Additionally, they offer an excellent way for teens to stay safe by allowing them to call 911 in case of emergency situations. These are just a few reasons why some people support giving smartphones to teens at a younger age than before. However, others argue that having access to phones at such young ages could lead to dangerous or unhealthy behavior from teens who may become addicted texting while driving or using social media excessively instead of focusing on schoolwork. Moreover, there are concerns regarding security when it comes to sharing personal information online via chat rooms and other applications without adequate parental control measures being put into place by adults first. Finally, some people worry about potential cyberbullying incidents when adolescents have unrestricted access on their phone devices these worries often stem from past experiences where victims either had no means of escape from relentless bullying campaigns due largely in part because they didnt possess any listening ears in real life at home nor any reliable methods for reporting cases effectively through adult channels even if available options were present beyond immediate circles of peers involved directly within abusive conversations taking place behind closed doors virtually over Internet networks . . Clearly then , adults must weigh carefully both sides of the argument before making decisions related with granting teenagers free use of mobile devices so as not only ensure their physical safety but also protect psychological wellbeing adequately against threats posed by irresponsible technology usage moving forward during modern times ahead filled with ever increasing digital opportunities accompanying various risks associated potentially down along,",

"The proliferation of fast fashion in recent years has made a huge impact on the environment. While many consumers view this as an inexpensive way to keep up with current trends, this type of clothing production is far from sustainable and can have grave consequences for our planet. Fast fashion refers to clothing that is designed quickly, produced cheaply and sold at lower prices than other types of production, such as higher end luxury brands. It is most often found in chain stores or online outlets with quick turnaround times between new collections released each season. By providing customers with low cost options that change frequently, companies like HM, Zara, Forever 21 and ASOS have capitalized on consumer demand for trendier garments that are viewed as disposable items  meaning they are only worn a few times before being discarded or donated. The problem lies within the unsustainable methods used by these companies to produce their wares so quickly while keeping costs down. For instance, most apparel factories use nonorganic cotton which requires more water and pesticides during cultivation compared to organic fibers fabrics derived from oilbased polyester require massive amounts of energy to manufacture hazardous chemicals are also used in mass quantities during processing stages such as dyeing fabric colors waste created through overproduction then ends up landfills where it takes decades  if not centuries  to decompose completely lastly transportation involved transporting clothes around the world increases emissions into our atmosphere significantly. All this adds up to one very large carbon footprint resulting from fast fashion production practices putting strain on our already fragile ecosystems and further contributing towards global climate change issues . To combat this issue we must begin by educating ourselves about how harmful fast fashion actually is and hold corporations accountable for their actions when possible  both through government regulationslaws but also via boycotts or other means available for individuals who want make an impact. Additionally ,we should all make better purchasing decisions by choosing items less often but buying quality pieces when needed instead which will extend its lifespan,",

"The industrial revolution was a pivotal point in the history of our nation, and its impact is still felt today. This period of technological progress saw rapid advances in the production of goods and services all over Europe, ultimately resulting in profound alterations to everyday life. During this period, one particular industry that underwent transformation was cotton spinning. By replacing human labor with machines powered by coal or steam engines, this new technology enabled much faster production rates while also reducing costs. In England during the 18th century, most cotton spinning factories were located near areas where cheap coal could be obtained easily many were even constructed close to rivers to take advantage of natural sources of water power for running machinery. The invention of Richard Arkwrights Water Frame further increased efficiency as it allowed multiple spindles to run at once using only a single hand crank  which itself had been improved upon following James Hargreaves introduction of his patented Spinning Jenny. Beyond their improvements on productivity and costeffectiveness however, these early machines also provided an opportunity for factory workers throughout Britain and beyond to increase their wages through higher piece rate payment systems  something which drastically altered society as it meant more people now had access to greater earning potential than before. This newfound economic freedom enabled many individuals who previously would not have had the chance otherwise gain access into the middle class or even eventually become wealthy themselves indeed some entrepreneurs such as Robert Owen who made their fortune from cotton mills went on to establish philanthropic foundations aimed at improving living conditions for mill workers throughout Britain and abroad too. . Whilst there certainly were drawbacks associated with such advances in technology  namely job displacement caused by automation and exploitation due excessive working hours among other things  overall it is clear that without innovations such as those pioneered during the industrial revolution world may look very different today therefore we owe immense gratitude towards those who helped make possible what we now enjoy today through inventions  advancements made centuries ago,",

"The increasing popularity of traveling to remote destinations in search of adventure has created a growing demand for specialized gear. For the brave souls who seek out unexplored and isolated locations, investing in highend equipment is essential to their success and safety. From camping gear designed for extreme weather conditions to stateoftheart navigational technology, these items provide an invaluable resource both during and after a journey. Having the right supplies can mean the difference between surviving or perishing when faced with dangerous conditions far away from civilization. Camping equipment such as tents are essential components of any adventurous travelers arsenal. Stateofthe art lightweight tents are available that use sophisticated materials like polyester fabrics which prevent heat loss during cold temperatures while still remaining light enough for carrying on long treks through rough terrain. Alongside this must come sleeping bags with down insulation, allowing travelers to easily retain body heat even in frigid climates. Furthermore, having windproof stoves such as those constructed with titanium enables backpackers to cook meals quickly without worrying about gusty winds ruining their meal plans along the way. . Navigation tools have also become increasingly important for long trips into uncharted territory due to advancements like GPS systems combined with handheld devices known as Personal Locator Beacons PLBs. By using these two technologies together adventurers have access not only basic location but also more detailed data such as altitude readings, topographical maps and even real time weather forecasts which can be lifesavers if trekking across treacherous landscapes where hazardous meteorological events may occur suddenly without warning flash floods, snow storms etc. . In addition, wearables such as smart watches equipped with wireless communication capabilities represent yet another layer of security should someone get lost they now have the ability send off emergency messages asking nearby people or rescue teams for help while simultaneously logging vital health data over time so medical professionals can assess what type treatment might be necessary upon eventual recovery from whatever predicament has befall,",

"INTRODUCTION  Due to the growing burden of disease in South Africa  encompassing conditions such as tuberculosis  human immunodeficiency virus  and cancer  the holistic management of affected patients incorporating ototoxicity monitoring is a necessity  However  ototoxicity monitoring in developing countries may be limited due to a lack of resources and inadequate healthcare facilities  Subsequently  the use of teleaudiology may be a revolutionary technique with the potential to provide audiology services to underserved populations with limited access  METHODS  The study aimed to describe the use of teleaudiology services in ototoxicity monitoring through a scoping review of English peerreviewed articles from June 2009 to June 2020  Seventeen articles were purposively selected from the following databases  PubMed  Science Direct  Taylor and Francis Online  WorldCat  and Google Scholar  Data was extracted as per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses diagram and results were analyzed using deductive thematic analysis  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  While a minority of the studies indicated that the cost of implementation and network connectivity within a South African context pose as barriers  most researchers reported that teleaudiology provides a reliable  timeefficient  costeffective  and easily accessible alternative for ototoxicity monitoring  Hardware including the WAHTS  KUDUwave  and OtoID  along with software such as the TabSINT  Otocalc  uHear  and the hearTest  have proven to be useful for ototoxicity monitoring  A need for further investigations regarding the feasibility of teleaudiology implementation in South Africa is evident  Despite this  it provides audiologists with an opportunity to offer contactless services during COVID19  thus  confirming its versatility as an augmentative method for ototoxicity monitoring,",

"Technology has been an integral part of modern life, allowing us to communicate and access information more quickly than ever before. At the same time, it is important to remember that technology can also be used productively in education. With the right tools and strategies, educators can use technology as a way to engage students and facilitate learning. One of the best ways for teachers to incorporate technology into their classrooms is through flipped learning models. In this approach, traditional teaching methods are replaced with instruction delivered online or through other digital means like podcasts or videos. Students watch presentations at home then come into class ready to discuss the material they learned. This allows instructors more time during class sessions for interactive activities that help reinforce key concepts from lectures while providing them with valuable feedback on student understanding of each topic covered in class. . Another effective educational tool is virtual reality VR. Through VR simulations and immersive experiences developed specifically for eductional settings, teachers can give students handson practice using various concepts without breaking budgets or sacrificing safety protocols like social distancing measures set by local health departments due to COVID19 concerns. Additionally, VR provides unique opportunities for projectbased learning having students work together on complex tasks such as designing a 3D structure or recreating a historical battle gives evidence of mastering knowledge rather than simply regurgitating facts from textbooks alone  boosting confidence among learners along the way. Finally, online collaboration platforms allow groups of students who would otherwise never meet facetoface get together virtually so they can collaboratively solve tough problems while exchanging ideas across geographic distances  something which was nearly impossible just 10 years ago With these solutions available today even small classroom sizes dont need stand between an instructor and engaged student interactions anymore because everyone can join forces digitally anytime day or night. Overall it is clear that technology offers many great benefits when used correctly in educational settings helping improve engagement levels while exposing learners to exciting new possibilities offered by advancements in,",

"The development of mathematics is a fascinating story. It has been a part of human life since the dawn of civilization, with our earliest ancestors relying on their understanding of numbers to survive in their environment. Even today, math remains an important tool for problem solving and discovering new solutions to complex problems. The history of mathematics can be traced back thousands of years, beginning with ancient Mesopotamians who used basic counting systems to track goods and taxation payments. This knowledge was passed down through generations until it reached the Greeks, who developed geometry as a way to measure land boundaries and calculate areas in fields. The Romans followed this trend by introducing the concept of zero into their numerical system this allowed them to solve equations more efficiently than ever before. As time progressed, mathematicians continued refining existing theories while also creating new ones that changed how we understand our world. For example, Isaac Newtons work on calculus unlocked deeper insights into physical forces like gravity and motion these findings revolutionized science and engineering across all disciplines. In addition, advances in algebra made it possible for computers to interpret data more accurately than ever beforeenabling us to make rapid breakthroughs in technology and medicine over recent decades. . In modern times, mathematics continues playing an integral role in many aspects of society. From predicting weather patterns using statistical analysis or mapping out subway routes using graph theory algorithmsthe applications are farreaching and incredibly powerful We are now even seeing highlevel computational tasks being applied directly onto everyday products such as smartphones or carsallowing us unprecedented access to information about ourselves or our devices at any given moment. All told, the history behind mathematics is truly remarkable from its humble beginnings tracking goods  taxation payments centuries ago all the way up till now where we use computers powered by sophisticated mathematical models daily without even realizing itits clear that math will always have an impact on humanity moving forward,",

"The potential risk of spreading a virus during bus transportation motivates us to understand the aerosol transmission of SARSCoV2 and seek effective ways to protect passengers in a bus  In this paper  a typical scenario in which the virus spreads in a bus under a windless environment is numerically studied for further understanding of the spreading characteristics of aerosol transmission in an enclosed space  The air flow in the bus and the spreading processes of droplets with different open windows configurations are obtained and analyzed  The variations of droplet concentration in the air with time are examined and analyzed  In addition  the transient droplet concentration deposited on the passengers is also counted to analyze the potential contact transmission  The results indicate that opening a window next to an infected person shows an unsatisfactory performance in limiting droplet spreading range and reducing droplet concentration  eventually leading to a high risk of infection by aerosol transmission following contact transmission  In addition  opening multiple windows also shows an unsatisfactory result for removing droplets in a bus since the turbulence flow accelerates the spreading speed and expands the spreading range  In contrast  the droplets are removed from the indoor space of the bus quickly if a window is opened in the row in front of the infected person  which is beneficial for reducing aerosol and contact transmission in the bus  Furthermore  it is strongly recommended to avoid sitting in the row in front of the infected person where the highest droplet concentration can be observed,",

"The purpose of this article is to advance the concept of bodiesinwaiting as an everyday infrastructure to explain the shifting nature of  pandemic cities  in response to the changing dynamics of infection control in urban spaces  While previous literatures have been  sanitized  to emphasize the importance of managing optimal physiological health and safety  we would like to argue that keener attention is needed to rethink the constitutive role of bodies in coproducing a city s sociopolitical ecologies at this time of crisis  The main body is divided into three sections  The first section introduces the political dimensions of pandemic response by various governments with an emphasis to experiences of middle to low income countries  Our intention is to show how these studies bring into light the role of local politics of pandemic response within countries  and that actual governance mechanisms in cities are shaped and contested by shifting power blocs and emergent affinities  The second section forwards an embodied urban political approach that conceptualizes bodiesinwaiting as infrastructure  In this view  bodiesinwaiting is produced and reproduced by complex socialmaterial flows and transformation rooted in variegated matrices of power through which urban spaces are  re assembled  The last section demonstrates a sample case that shows how bodiesinwaiting as infrastructure are understood using Twittersourced data associated with the Philippine government s disciplinary quarantine measures which started March 12  2020 in the NCR  At its core  bodiesinwaiting as infrastructures populate a politically affirmative urban imaginary of bodies living on despite the existence of an accelerated and mutating virus in slower moving cities,",

"It is often said that knowledge is power, and nowhere can this be truer than in the field of computer programming. As technology advances and more people become comfortable with computers, having a good understanding of their inner workings will stand to benefit those who possess it. The purpose of this essay is to discuss the importance of learning the basics of computer programming for todays world. Computer programming has been an integral part of our lives for many years now, providing solutions to complex tasks and facilitating activities such as communication, data storage, game playing and so on. However, as technology grows evermore sophisticated by leaps and bounds every day, it becomes increasingly necessary to have a basic understanding of how these programs work in order to make full use out of them otherwise one risks being left behind while everyone else reaps the benefits they offer. Computer programs are essentially collections instructions which tell a machine what it needs do by knowing how these instructions work together we gain greater control over our machines allowing us to manipulate them into doing exactly what we want them do instead if relying solely on what others provide us with. One way through which learning basic computer programming can help is through writing algorithms or automating tedious tasks that would otherwise take much longer when done manually. For example say you wanted create your own system which would automatically send emails at certain times each day  you could write some code which does just that after spending some time researching about email protocols first Other applications include creating websites easily without needing know HTML or other web languages developing programs for mobile phones without needing download those expensive software packages offered online etc., all simply by taking advantage off existing frameworks available from companies like Apple and Google. Additionally, knowing even basics like JavaScript a widely used language can open up opportunities such as getting internshipsjobs related coding or building custom applications tailored specifically towards your requirements rather then using ones already made available elsewhere which may not necessarily suit all needs. In conclusion it should,",

"An essay about the power of music on peoples emotions. Music has long been known to evoke powerful emotions in its listeners. From uplifting classical compositions, to soulful blues songs, and intense rock anthems  music can bring out feelings buried deep within our subconscious back into our conscious minds. Even socalled happy songs can have a profound affect on how we feel they may remind us of good times or help us cope with more difficult experiences. The power of music lies in its ability to tell stories without words  conveying joys, sorrows, hopes and dreams through the sounds it makes alone. This is why humans throughout history have used this art form as a means for expressing their own emotionality and thoughts from religious chants sung by monks centuries ago all the way up to modern day pop hits written as an outlet for personal musings or public outcries against injustice. In fact, many composers over time have stated that their pieces were created not only for entertainment but also as a way of communicating ideas which could not be expressed any other way. Furthermore, research has shown how listening to certain types of music can influence moods both negatively and positively jazz tunes are said to reduce stress levels while upbeat pop numbers might make us feel energized sad ballads may make us cry yet simultaneously invoke feelings of comfort as if someone understands what were going through. So whether we use it intentionally or unintentionally  consciously selecting suitable songs for various scenarios  there is no denying that music holds immense sway over our emotional states at any given point in time. It thus stands as one of lifes greatest gifts providing solace when needed most and serving as a reminder that even during dark days there remains light somewhere among those notes singing sweetly around us like angels smiling down from above,",

"The continuance of the COVID19 pandemic largely depends on the spread of viruscarrying aerosols in ambient air  The mechanism of virus transmission and infection remains under intense investigation  In this study  an evaporation flow model of airborne sputum droplets is proposed which considers the evolution effects of the humidity field under different particle distributions and solid salt fraction interactions  The incompressible NavierStokes equations characterize a stream of airflow jets  and the convectiondiffusionevaporation process is used to account for the inhomogeneous humidity field caused by the respiratory tract  Momentum equations for droplet dynamics which involve the effects of drag  gravity  and Brownian motion on sputum droplets are introduced to quantify the transport of droplets in a humidity field  The Lattice Boltzmann method is used to track the evolution of the aerosol in space and time under different ambient temperature and relative humidity conditions  The results of the simulation demonstrate that airborne humidity accelerates the evaporation rate of droplet  while supersaturated humid air forms a vapor mass in front of the respiratory tract  Despite the short lifespan of this phenomenon  it significantly hinders the evaporation of the droplets  Besides  the droplet vortex dynamics in a humidity field are sensitive to the droplet size,",

"As a species, humans have always been determined to advance and innovate Throughout history, we have developed new technologies and made incredible discoveries in science, mathematics, engineering, and much more Even today we continue to push the boundaries of knowledge by creating groundbreaking ideas that can change our lives for the better The most obvious example of human advancement is technology Wave seen significant developments since prehistoric times with tools like fire and stone knives being used as early as 400 000 BC The industrial revolution brought new machines capable of mass production which drastically changed human life throughout the 19th century In modern times, computers have arguably had the largest impact on society through widespread use in nearly all aspects of life from entertainment to medicine to communication across vast distances  something that was previously impossible Of course advancements beyond just technology are important too science has allowed us to understand phenomena such as disease or astrophysics while mathematics allows us to answer questions about abstract concepts like infinity or probability theory Over time these fields have evolved into rich topics full of knowledge that can be applied in everyday situations whether its predicting an eclipse or solving a mathematical equation at school Lastly engineering has its own unique importance because it provides practical uses for all this scientific knowledge by applying them into real world scenarios ranging from buildings infrastructure projects bridges skyscrapers down to small scale items like phones  tablets etc. Engineers are responsible for some amazing creations including everything from satellites orbiting Earth for weather info space exploration, self driven cars used widely today right down devices no bigger than a grain of sand operated using nanotechnology  Ultimately without innovation and progress there would be no humanity as we know it today no Facebook chats over coffee with friends halfway across the globe nor medicines capable of saving millions every year due diseases none of those things would exist if not for our collective efforts towards brining forth advances large  small within various branches such sciences  mathematics,",

"The rise of electric cars has been one of the most important developments in the automotive industry over the last decade. They offer a clean and efficient alternative to traditional gaspowered vehicles while still providing an enjoyable driving experience. This shift towards electric cars has sparked a great deal of debate among policymakers, environmentalists, and consumers alike. Proponents of electric vehicles argue that they are better for the environment due to their lower emissions output compared to traditional gasolinepowered engines. Electric motors emit significantly less carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than their combustion engine counterparts which is beneficial for air quality. Furthermore, electric vehicles require much less maintenance than combustion engines since they dont need oil changes or tune ups as often making them more cost effective in the long run. Additionally, many governments around the world have implemented tax incentives and subsidies to encourage people to purchase electric vehicles further incentivizing buyers who may be on a tight budget but want to explore greener options with their car purchases. On the other hand, skeptics point out that despite being cleaner overall compared with petrol engines, there are still some environmental drawbacks associated with running an EV such as difficultly disposing of batteries after their life cycles end or sourcing renewable energy sources from which electricity must be drawn from in order for EVs to become truly green solutions moving forward. Moreover, manufacturing process itself required for producing EVs is estimated by some estimates to generate between 20  30 more pollutants than those generated during normal vehicle production processes leaving many wondering how much greener these cars really are at every stage over its lifetime if renewable energy sources remain elusive possibilities down line. Lastly, critics suggest that electric cars currently lack infrastructure support due lack current charging facilities being limited even within major cities leaving drivers without easy access refueling stations when they needed them most particularly when traveling outside regular commuting routes thus reducing potential customer base interested in purchasing models regardless how environmentally friendly they may be otherwise seen as technically speaking. .

"As recent advancements in technology have become more and more innovative, so too has the landscape of home automation. Home Automation is the use of technology to remotely monitor and control a variety of home functions such as lighting, climate control, entertainment systems, appliance usage and security systems. With a few simple commands from your smartphone or voice command unit you can now make sure that all aspects of your home are running smoothly even when youre away on vacation. One way people are using this new form of home automation is by controlling their lights from their smartphones or other digital devices. You can easily preset different scenes for different times during the day or night dimming the lights at bedtime, setting them to an evening romance mode before dinner with your partner or dimming them down low during movie nights with friends. By syncing up these controls with motion sensors throughout each room you can also ensure that any movement will cause certain lights to automatically come on which can be both convenient and great for safety if someone needs extra light while moving around your house late at night. Climate control is another area where people are taking advantage of advances in technology through automated temperature settings throughout their homes. Smart thermostats allow users to set temperatures based on specific periods throughout each day rather than just one setting all day long which helps reduce energy costs while still keeping everyone comfortable no matter what time they enter a space within the house  though it may take some trial and error finding out how much heating and cooling needs to happen at various points in time This same process applies to humidification levels as well since many modern thermostats now come equipped with humidity sensors as well meaning things like mold growth prevention can be quickly addressed without manual intervention needed every single time something becomes imbalanced inside our houses.

"The ability to effectively and efficiently manage time is an essential skill in life. Many people have difficulty with this, particularly in todays fastpaced world where responsibilities are seemingly endless. Not only can effective time management improve ones overall productivity, but it can also help individuals lead a more balanced lifestyle by allowing them to prioritize tasks and allocate resources to maximize their efficiency. Time management involves setting goals, creating plans of action, staying organized, minimizing distractions and making the most of every minute. It is important to be realistic when setting goals ambitious yet achievable targets should be set so that progress can be seen with each step taken towards success  this is key for maintaining motivation levels throughout the process. Planning ahead helps break larger tasks into smaller ones which makes them easier to accomplish within a certain amount of time having a clear idea of what needs to be done eliminates any guesswork or confusion associated with working on something new. Furthermore, establishing efficient organizational habits will ensure that work remains focused and clutter free as well as ensuring easy access when necessary  this saves valuable minutes from being wasted during searches for misplaced items. Distraction should also be avoided if possible these include procrastination which often leads nowhere and overthinking which may cause mental roadblocks exist due to too much analysis paralysis  instead just take action Additionally multitasking rarely pays off despite how productive it may initially appear since focus gets split between tasks resulting in slower completion times than would usually occur had they been worked on individually  managing one task at a time without interruption will get you better results faster Finally taking full advantage of available moments such as waiting periods or gaps between classesjobs allows quick bursts of concentration leading up achievement faster than expected  even small amounts add up over time. Effective Time Management ultimately helps us make the best use out our days while still keeping track all important aspects our lives.

"Objective  The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019  COVID19   declared as a major public health emergency  has had profound effects on public mental health especially emotional status  Due to professional requirements  medical staff are at a higher risk of infection  which might induce stronger negative emotions  This study aims to reveal the emotional status of Chinese frontline medical staff in the early epidemic period to better maintain their mental health  and provide adequate psychological support for them  Methods  A national online survey was carried out in China at the early stage of the COVID19 epidemic  In total  3025 Chinese frontline medical staff took part in this investigation which utilized a general information questionnaire  the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire  ERQ   and the Berkeley Expressivity Questionnaire  BEQ   Results  At the early stage of COVID19  anxiety was the most common negative emotion of Chinese medical staff  followed by sadness  fear  and anger  mainly at a mild degree  which declined gradually over time  Nurses had the highest level of negative emotions compared with doctors and other healthcare workers  Women experienced more fear than men  younger and unmarried medical staff had more anxiety and fear compared with elders and married ones  Risk perception and emotional expressivity increased negative emotions  cognitive reappraisal reduced negative emotions  while negative emotions led to more avoidant behavior and more physical health disturbances  in which negative emotions mediated the effect of risk perception on avoidant behavior tendency in the model test  Conclusion  Chinese frontline medical staff experienced a mild level of negative emotions at the early stage of COVID19  which decreased gradually over time  The findings suggest that during the epidemic  nurses  mental health should be extensively attended to  as well as women  younger  and unmarried medical staff  To better ensure their mental health  reducing risk perception and improving cognitive reappraisal might be important  which are potentially valuable to form targeted psychological interventions and emotional guidance under crisis in the future,",

Its a way to learn about the past, what happened in different places around the world, who or what caused events, and how it all came together to shape our present reality. The study of history can be both inspiring and intimidating as we delve into facts from times long gone by. No matter which period of time you choose to focus on, there is something unique and exciting to explore. Take Ancient Greece for example it was a civilization that had some of the greatest contributions known in human history. From their philosophy to art, literature, architecture and more  they were truly ahead of their time with many ideas still resonating today. Their impact on society cannot be understated when considering the development of democracy and other governmental structures that are still used today across the worlds nations. Its easy enough to get lost in historical texts regarding Ancient Greece but if one takes a step back they will find incredible stories told among their ruins throughout mainland Europe itself including Delphi which played host at one point in time for dramatic competitions between famous playwrights such as Euripides amongst others These tales have not only left behind physical evidences like monuments or amphitheaters but also deep lessons from those who experienced them firsthand  even thousands of years ago these same messages remain valid for us now here in our own life journey through spacetime. . In conclusion, understanding history is essential for us humans because it serves as an anchor that keeps us grounded within our trajectory  helping maintain social stability while allowing progress towards future developments however far away those may seem right now Taking a look into this vast web woven by countless individuals across eras helps bring clarity amidst uncertainty providing insight into ourselves  shaping up our decisions based off lessons learnt instead of repeating mistakes made centuries ago when faced with similar situations today,",

While it may not be easy for seniors to learn how to navigate the digital world of today, taking the time to understand these technologies can bring about tremendous benefits for them. Seniors who take advantage of new technologies have access to an array of information that was once unavailableor at least much more difficultto find without computers or smartphones. From researching potential health concerns online, staying uptodate on current events across the globe, or finding amusing games like crosswords and word searches on their phonesthere is no shortage of activities available if you know where to look Seniors may even be able to rekindle old friendships by joining social media sites specifically geared towards older adults so that they can reconnect with past acquaintances regardless of their location. Additionally, apps like Skype are incredibly useful for multigenerational families as grandparents now have a convenient way for communicating with their grandchildrenby video chatting The possibilities become all but endless when seniors venture into cyberspace however significant progress cannot be made until proper education takes place first. Senior centers often offer classes teaching basic computing skills such as typing proficiency and navigating webpages through mouse cursor techniques. This allows elders unfamiliar with technology an opportunity practice using a computer in a safe environment without feeling intimidated or judged by others around them while also receiving helpful tips from knowledgeable instructors along the way too Depending on your local areas offerings there could also potentially be specific courses focusing solely on using programs like Microsoft Word or Excel which would provide yet another beneficial skill set under their belts should they ever need,",

"In recent years, the rise of remote work has changed the landscape of traditional employment. While this new way of working brings many advantages to employees and employers alike, it is not without its drawbacks. For employees, one potential issue that comes with remote work is isolation and lack of connection with colleagues and supervisors. As a result, maintaining motivation for yourself can be difficult when you dont have people around you providing support or feedback on your progress. Additionally, since communication usually takes place through electronic means such as email or Slack messages rather than facetoface conversations, misunderstandings are more likely to occur due to miscommunication between parties. For employers who employ workers remotely, training and onboarding can be especially challenging since they cannot provide inperson instruction like they would if they had office staff. Employers must also trust their remote workers to remain productive while away from their direct line of supervision which can create issues with accountability depending on the type of job being done and how well each worker handles responsibility outside an office setting. Furthermore, creating a company culture may be harder for those businesses run entirely by remote workers given that teambuilding activities most typically take place in person where everyone involved has access to each other at once building relationships over video chat or Skype calls may prove inadequate in comparison. Ultimately though, if managed properly there are numerous benefits achievable when companies let their employees work remotely such as increased productivity due to fewer distractions found in typical offices settings as well as decreased overhead costs associated with having an entire workforce under one roof utilities expenses etc.. The key factor here lies within effective management making sure all expectations are clearly communicated between employer and employee so that tasks get completed efficiently regardless if someones actually present inside the workplace at any given moment or not,",

"Technology has had a tremendous impact on our lives over the last few decades, revolutionizing how we communicate, travel, and learn. From smartphones to virtual reality to smart homes, technology has become an integral part of modern life. But one area that is often overlooked when discussing technology's advancement is mathematics. Mathematics is not only essential for the development of technologies like artificial intelligence but also finds application in nearly every field imaginable from accounting to engineering. In fact, the use of mathematical methods in all areas of science dates back centuries with scholars such as Euclid developing geometry concepts that are still taught today. These early pioneers established many fundamental principles which have since been used by scientists and mathematicians alike to develop new theories and ideas about the world around us such as Newtons laws of motion or Galileo's astronomical discoveries further advances have allowed us to explore space, solve complex equations and even predict weather patterns. The power of mathematics lies in its universality it can be applied across disciplines including physics, economics and computer science where algorithms have enabled powerful machines that outperform humans at certain tasks. Without mathematical models there could be no understanding between different fields leading research projects astray  instead math provides a common ground so researchers from diverse backgrounds can build upon each others work together creating more accurate models which better enhance our knowledge base for future generations. Mathematics also helps us understand ourselves better through statistics allowing data to tell stories quickly without bias or exaggeration illustrating trends within populations providing insights into consumer behavior or health issues affecting society meaning decisions made using this information would be far more informed than if they were based on personal opinion alone Ultimately mathematics gives us insight into humanity helping create robust systems that benefit all while challenging existing paradigms opening up possibilities previously inconceivable before their introduction  an invaluable resource indeed. To conclude it should go without saying that mathematics plays an important role in modern life whether it is aiding technological advancements or providing clarity,",

"The rise of virtual reality technology has completely revolutionized the gaming industry over the past decade. With its ability to create immersive, lifelike experiences for users without leaving the comfort of their own home, its no wonder why VR is now being adopted by many gamers and developers alike. However, there are still some challenges that need to be addressed in order for VR to become even more widely accepted and utilized. One major challenge with virtual reality is how best to integrate it into existing games and console systems. While there have been advancements towards making this a possibility such as PlayStations recent PSVR headset, hardware compatibility can still be an issue depending on the type of system or game being used. Additionally, most current consoles are not powerful enough yet to provide smooth framerates while running a game simultaneously in both 2D and 3D formatsa requirement when utilizing virtual reality headsets like Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. In order for these platforms to reach wider audiences and become even more popular than they already are, further improvements need to be made in regards to hardware integration capabilities within existing gaming systems. Another difficulty with virtual reality technology lies within motion sickness caused by certain aspects of gameplay such as rapid camera movements or extended exposure time within a simulation environment motion sickness can easily ruin the experience for those susceptible despite them having excellent specs on their computer or console setup. Unfortunately due to physiological differences between individuals this issue has proven tricky from both technical and design perspectives however, developers are continuously looking at ways in which they can reduce motion sickness through improved programming methods such as allowing players more control over simulated movement speeds during playtime sessions  something that should improve user satisfaction down the line if implemented correctly. Lastly, although one strength of VR is its realism factor compared with standard video games  developers must still face a difficult task when attemptingto accurately simulate real life environments due various physical laws that come into play gravity etc. When creating digital worlds currently available,",

"Background  Russia has been portrayed in media as having one of the highest death tolls due to the COVID19 pandemic in the world  However  the precise scale of excess mortality is still unclear  We provide the first estimates of excess mortality in Russia as a whole and its regions in 2020  placing this in an international context  Methods  We used monthly death rates for Russia and 83 regions plus the equivalent for 36 comparator countries  Expected mortality was derived in two ways using averages in the same months in preceding years and the same averages adjusted for secular trends  Excess death rates were estimated for the whole year and the last 3 quarters  We also estimated the relationships between excess mortality and reported COVID19 cases and deaths across countries and Russian regions  Results  Estimating excess deaths rates based on the trendadjusted average  Russia had the highest excess mortality of any of the 37 countries considered  Using the simple average  Russia had the third highest  Most of the excess deaths were recorded in the 4th quarter of 2020 and the level and trajectory of excess mortality in Russia and most of Eastern European countries differed from that in Western countries  While both the cumulative number of COVID19 cases and deaths showed positive correlations with excess mortality across countries  r 0 65 and r 0 75  p0 001   the association across the Russian regions was  surprisingly  negative for cases  r 0 34  p0 01  and deaths  r 0 09  p 0 42   When we replaced reported deaths with final data from death certificates the correlation was positive  r 0 38  p0 001   Conclusion  Russia has one of the largest absolute burden of excess mortality in 2020 but there is a counterintuitive negative association between excess mortality and cumulative incidence at the regional level  Underrecording of COVID19 cases seems to be a problem in some regions,",
"In this paper  we analyze program activity for Family Connects  FC   an evidencebased postpartum homevisiting intervention  during the COVID19 pandemic  When the pandemic began  FC transitioned to a virtual protocol which maintains key psychosocial components of the inperson protocol and adjusts health assessments to address the lack of inperson contact  Program performance is contrasted for periods before the pandemic onset  April 2019March 2020  and after the onset  April 2020March 2021   involving 10 280 scheduled visits and 6696 visited families  46  nonHispanic white  20  nonHispanic Black  23  Hispanic  and 10  other race   Postpandemic onset  FC program participation rates were at 89 8  of prepandemic levels  Home visitors observed postonset increases in families  concerns about home safety but declines in families  needs related to infant care  Community connections were facilitated for 42 9  of visited families postpandemic onset compared to 51 1  prepandemic onset  We conclude that postpandemic onset virtual delivery rates of FC declined but are high enough to merit continued implementation during a period when some families will decline inperson visits  When inperson visits are deemed safe per public health guidelines  the findings suggest a hybrid approach that could maximize program outreach by prioritizing inperson contact and offering virtual delivery as a second choice,",

"The world has seen a great many advancements in the realms of science, technology, and mathematics over the course of human history. From Galileos revolutionary theories on astronomy to modernday computer programming techniques that have revolutionized communication and commerce around the globe, mankind has achieved remarkable feats due to its collective knowledge of these subjects. Math is perhaps one of the most powerful tools at our disposal when it comes to understanding how things work both in nature and culture. Its basis in logic enables us to apply mathematical principles for problem solving in all areas of life from finance to engineering, construction projects and more. Math gives us a way to measure or quantify various aspects or processes so we can better understand them as well as make predictions about future trends or events. It also helps us identify patterns and relationships between objects or phenomena which are otherwise difficult for us to perceive using only our senses. In addition, math provides an opportunity for creative expression through its various branches such as geometry where shapes can be manipulated into visually pleasing arrangements reminiscent of works by master painters like Michelangelo or Piet Mondrian algebraic equations providing a neat solution path calculus allowing complex calculations like those used by astronomers plotting orbits symmetries found in number theory graph theory enabling efficient transportation methods amongst other uses  just some examples out of many showing how mathematical skills can be applied towards artistic purposes too. Moreover, math is essential for developing critical thinking skills which are invaluable when making decisions based on evidence rather than opinion alone since it encourages students and others to look beyond surface level information before reaching conclusions regarding any given situation. This way they become more adept at recognizing logical fallacies while being able comprehend multiple perspectives with greater ease resulting in higher levels reasoning overall thereby equipping them better face challenges presented by everyday life as well truly succeed academicallyprofessionally too.

"The impact of sustainability on the fashion industry is becoming more and more evident every day. In order to combat environmental issues such as climate change, pollution, and waste production, sustainable fashion is being increasingly advocated for. This type of fashion focuses on creating pieces that are recyclable, ecofriendly materials or those made from renewable sources like bamboo or organic cotton. Not only does this help reduce the negative effects of fast fashion but it also helps contribute to a better world in terms of raw material usage and overall sustainability goals. In addition to reducing its carbon footprint, sustainable fashion has other benefits toofrom an economic standpoint as well as ethically speaking. From an economic standpoint, companies who adopt practices such as using natural fibers over synthetic fabrics can save money by eliminating hazardous chemicals found in many traditional materials used for clothing production. Additionally, using recycled fabric means less energy is needed during manufacturing processes which not only reduces costs but decreases emissions too. On top of that, the ethical aspect of sustainable fashion should be taken into consideration when talking about its importance its important to remember fair wages paid out to workers at all stages along the supply chain and their working conditions while they produce garments you buy Furthermore any alternative methods used instead of synthetic dyes such as vegetable dyeing benefit both local communities through job creation  providing safe use products without damaging local water resources around them  these advantages cannot be ignored. Sustainable Fashion plays an important role in our society today  with brands making their way onto store shelves like Urban Outfitters, awareness around conscious consumption has become mainstreamed within culture at large  were seeing events highlighting environmentally friendly design like Londons EcoFashion Week. Its clear that people today have been more aware than ever before about how our decisions affect the environment  social responsibility associated with buying clothing  so make sure you check labels  support brands that prioritize sustainability before purchasing your next piece,",

"The benefits of taking up running as a hobby are numerous and undeniable. Running is not only an effective form of cardiovascular exercise, but also provides mental relief and helps to reduce stress levels. In addition, starting running as a hobby can be extremely simple to do no complex equipment or training regimen is neededonly some comfortable shoes and an open space. The main physical benefit of running is that it helps strengthen the heart. By consistently engaging in aerobic activity such as jogging or sprinting, runners help improve their cardiovascular health by increasing their oxygen intake which allows them to better sustain rigorous physical activities for longer periods of time. This can help lower cholesterol levels, increase metabolism rate and even decrease body fat percentage over time when combined with proper nutrition routines. Along with these physiological improvements comes increased muscular strength throughout various areas depending on the type of run being performed i.e., sprinters will develop more leg muscles than distance runners. In terms of psychological benefits, regular runs have shown to help reduce anxiety by providing individuals with a periodical escape from daily pressures while at the same time encouraging positive thinking patterns which replace negative ones this leads to higher levels of selfconfidence and improved moods overall. Furthermore, endorphins released during exercise create feelings akin to euphoria thus enhancing sleep quality in those who struggle with sleeping disorders or insomnia caused by stress related factors amongst others. Lastly, since maintaining good fitness habits brings about many other healthy lifestyle choices such as sufficient hydration practices and balanced eating habits for example people who start regularly partaking in running exercises tend to become healthier overall due its holistic approach towards physical wellbeing . To conclude , beginning running as a hobby has been proven beneficial both physically and mentally offering users several advantages ranging from stronger hearts , reduced depression  anxiety , heightened senses along with enhanced moods  making it one fun way for everyone looking into becoming more active,",

"BACKGROUND  Among all of the studied potential causes of autism  vaccines have received some of the most scrutiny and have been the topic of many evidencebased studies  These efforts have led the great majority of scientists  physicians  and public health researchers to refute causation between vaccines and autism  RATIONALE  This presumed association and concern has been a major contributor to parents  refusal to immunize their children and has become a major threat to public health in secluded populations over the last two decades  even prior to the COVID19 pandemic  With the emergence of COVID19 immunizations  sentiments towards this topic were addressed as a public health concern that may influence the ability to overcome the Corona virus worldwide  SCIENTIFIC REVIEW OF DATA  Despite the overwhelming data demonstrating that there is no link between vaccines and autism  many parents are hesitant to immunize their children because of the alleged association  Other contributing factors to the myths and conspiracy theories surrounding the association between vaccines and autism include the fact that the diagnosis of autism is typically made after the age of receiving the main childhood immunizations  as well as the occasional occurrence of regression after the age of first year vaccinations  In spite of vast evidence that the main contribution to the increase in incidence is from improvement of the diagnostic process  this rapid and publicized rise in autism diagnoses feeds parental concerns regarding any medical intervention that may be associated with the health of their children  RECOMMENDATIONS  It is plausible that with more evidencebased studies linking autism to specific etiologies the myth will diminish and disappear eventually  In an era where conspiracy theories are prevalent on social media  it is critical that evidencebased studies relating autism to specific etiologies be made public  and that information concerning autism diagnosis and causes be made more readily available through social media and parental organizations,",

"The history of mathematics is an interesting and complex one, spanning centuries of development. From its ancient origins in Egypt, Mesopotamia, and China to the modern day theories that underlie our technological advancements, mathematics has been a pillar in understanding both physical reality and abstract concepts. Studying the history of mathematics can provide insight into how humans have constructed their beliefs about the natural world through symbolic reasoning. The earliest mathematical discoveries date back over 4500 years ago to Ancient Egypt where Archeologists found evidence of a primitive form of arithmetic called Hieratic which was used for measuring land area, taxation purposes, and creating calendars. The Babylonians developed algebraic equations around 1700 BCE while Ancient Greece made advances in geometry with works by Euclid such as Elements which still serves as a foundational text today. In 400 CE Indian mathematician Brahmagupta created fractions and solved quadratic equations while Diophantus wrote Arithmetical a collection on solving algebraic equations using only numbers. During the Renaissance period there were several important figures who revolutionized mathematical thought most notably Galileo Galilei who rejected Aristotelian logic declaring instead that knowledge could be gained through observation and experimentation leading to new techniques being applied to math such as Calculus from Sir Isaac Newton  Gottfried Leibniz in 1687. This allowed scientists to calculate more accurately situations involving velocity or acceleration moving away from Aristotle's qualitative approach towards more quantitative modes like statistics  probability theory developed by Blaise Pascal  Pierre de Fermat respectively during this time period too. In modern times Mathematics has become increasingly specialized allowing mathematicians access into new fields previously not available due to limitations set out by previous generations lack of technology or conceptual innovation from Chaos Theory providing insight on randomness  unpredictability inherent within nature itself all way up till Biomathematics where we see applications related specifically towards biology or medicine ie modelling disease spread.

"The importance of regular exercise is often overlooked in our modern society. Its easy to get so caught up in our busy lives and forget the true benefits that physical activity can provide us. From a physiological perspective, engaging in regular exercise helps to strengthen the heart and lungs, increase muscle mass, reduce fat stores, and improve overall energy levels. Exercise has been proven to have positive effects on mental health too it can help alleviate feelings of stress or depression by stimulating endorphin production which boosts mood and increases selfconfidence. In order to make sure we are reap the rewards that come with frequent exercise, its important for us to make time for it each week. Developing an achievable fitness routine is highly recommended as this will help ensure consistency over a longer period of time rather than trying and failing  to do vigorous bursts every once in awhile. Even something as simple as going for a walk around your neighborhood for 30 minutes two or three days per week can yield great results when done regularly. Additional physical activities such as swimming or cycling could also be added into your weekly routine if desired  these are both excellent forms of aerobic exercises which condition both the heart and lungs simultaneously while providing numerous other benefits related to strength building, coordination improvement and injury prevention especially during contact sports. Regular exercise not only serves immediate physiological purposes but should be part of ones lifestyle choices for longterm well being too studies demonstrate that people who engage in regular physical activity experience improved longevity compared those who lead more sedentary lifestyles due primarily reduced risks associated with chronic illnesses such as obesity, type 2 diabetes etc. Taking care of ourselves doesnt just involve following proper nutrition guidelines but making sure we stay active physically as much possible too ,",

"Education is one of the most important aspects of a persons life. No matter what age or stage in life, education plays an essential role in helping us to reach our full potential and become successful individuals. And while there are many different learning paths people can take, homeschooling has consistently been a viable option for those who seek a more individualized approach to their educational development. Homeschooling provides students with the opportunity to learn at their own pace, following customized lesson plans tailored towards their specific interests and abilities. This type of instruction allows them to gain invaluable knowledge without having to conform to traditional school schedules or curriculums that may not be best suited for meeting their needs as learners. Additionally, parents have the flexibility of crafting lessons around activities such as outdoor excursions and projects that help engage childrens minds and increase their awareness about the world around them  something often missing from larger classroom settings where everyone must move along at similar paces regardless of personal aptitude levels. Furthermore, by allowing children time away from typical social pressures they face when attending public schools this gives students more chance pursue other hobbies which can offer additional skillbuilding opportunities outside the realm of academia such as music or art classes that further refine creativity and critical thinking skills often overlooked within traditional classrooms environments. However, its worth noting that homeschooling isnt right for everyone due its strict reliance on parental involvement families typically need both dedicated time in some cases multiple hours per day as well financial resources allocated toward curriculum materials purchase before starting any homebased instructional program  things not all households may have access too so finding alternative methods must be considered if necessary .

criticism of the folks who run it for 2 big reasons    1  having written RES  I didn t want to jeopardize any sort of potential relationship with them  even though I never commercialized it nor did I intend to   2  I m old enough and mature enough to understand that businesses have business priorities  and that s just how the world works   but damn  does this section ever piss me off    It s very expensive to run   it takes millions of dollars to effectively subsidize other people s businesses   apps    It s an extraordinary amount of data  and these are for profit businesses built on our data for free    We have to cover our costs and so do they   that s the core of it    None of these things are technically false  but each of them has problems    The most important context that I feel the blackout should be used to educate people on is that Reddit didn t always have mobile apps  The ONLY REASON it gained mobile apps is because 3rd party developers built them    AlienBlue  which reddit eventually bought  was released in 2010 or so    BaconReader was released in 2012    Reddit Sync  my current favorite app I m about to lose  was released in 2012    Mobile traffic to reddit was practically an afterthought back then  It didn t make up a huge percentage of reddit traffic at all  The whole reason mobile has grown enough for reddit to now decide it wants to own the totality of mobile traffic is because of these third party developers    The whole reason their moderator ecosystem exists as it does today and does as good of a job as it can  sidebar  bad mods exist  but most are just passionate internet janitors who care about their communities  without r toolbox and to a lesser extent RES    To read  it takes millions of dollars to effectively subsidize other people s businesses   apps   is kind of insulting  honestly  First of all  if that was the phrase that was actually uttered  it s just obnoxious  They ve had WELL OVER A DECADE of watching mobile traffic and seeing it rise to decide to come up with a way to share revenue  If it was becoming a financial burden  they ve had MANY years to raise that issue and come up with a solution to it    They could ve started limiting API requests in 2015 and tested the waters for what was reasonable  They could ve started in 2016  2017    They could ve started working with devs on licensing agreements or other ways to share revenue or  uh   cover costs   But they didn t     It s an extraordinary amount of data  and these are for profit businesses built on our data for free      same thing  another dig at app developers suggesting they re some sort of horrible leeches  Woe is reddit  poor giant company with massive investors  If they didn t want people profiting off of it  they shouldn t have offered a free API and assumed nobody who made a great app would want to be compensated for it  Reddit s full of software engineers  Software engineers get paid good money  They re not going to quit their job or put 40  hours a week into an app on top of their job if it s free  Only one software engineer I know of is dumb enough to put that much work into something and never monetize it  and his name is u honestbleeps    We have to cover our costs and so do they   that s the core of it     really kind of a final straw for me  The APIs have existed for ages  and really haven t changed a ton  They re JSON endpoints  There s certainly a remote possibility that I m out of my element here  but  big tech  isn t exactly foreign to me and I have a VERY difficult time believing that the amount of API usage that an app like Apollo drums up  given it s the one they ve lambasted publicly and published numbers on  costs even a tiny fraction of what they re charging to  cover costs     imgur s API  bulk calls to Amazon s API   1 per 1 million requests using REST   etc are DRASTICALLY cheaper  Suggesting that the fees they want to charge are anywhere even remotely close to  covering costs  rather than  marking up costs by multiple orders of magnitude  is highly implausible    All of this just sucks  The dishonesty about it  their lack of progress in the past 13 years of existence of 3rd party apps existing toward a better solution than  go nuclear and shut them all down   etc  It s just awful    Are there some wild machinations in the background that make reddit s APIs cost far more to serve  I mean it s possible but my gut instinct as an engineer is it d speak to poor efficiency somewhere  or not utilizing caching and other tools as well  It seems fairly unlikely  It seems more like they just kept letting things slide for far too long  and now that they re going to go public  they ve been caught with their pants down over scrutiny on profitability    I m speculating  of course  I don t work for reddit  I don t get inside info from anyone who does  But everything I know about building software  including at scale  suggests that this is dishonest  I wish they d just say  yeah  it s a business decision  we re killing 3rd party apps    the  apparent  dishonesty just makes it far worse    damnit  I m really mad over this  and I m going to be even more mad when I

"After more than a year of the COVID19 pandemic  SARSCoV2 infection rates with newer variants continue to devastate much of the world  Global healthcare systems are overwhelmed with high positive patient numbers  Silent hypoxia accompanied by rapid deterioration and some cases with septic shock is responsible for COVID19 mortality in many hospitalized patients  There is an urgent need to further understand the relationships and interplay with human host components during pathogenesis and immune evasion strategies  Currently  acquired immunity through vaccination or prior infection usually provides sufficient protection against the emerging variants of SARSCoV2 except Omicron variant requiring recent booster  New strains have shown higher viral loads and greater transmissibility with more severe disease presentations  Notably  COVID19 has a peculiar prognosis in severe patients with iron dysregulation and hypoxia which is still poorly understood  Studies have shown abnormally low serum iron levels in severe infection but a high iron overload in lung fibrotic tissue  Data from our insilico structural analysis of the spike protein sequence along with host proteolysis processing suggests that the viral spike protein fragment mimics Hepcidin and is resistant to the major human proteases  This functional spikederived peptide dubbed  Covidin  thus may be intricately involved with host ferroportin binding and internalization leading to dysregulated host iron metabolism  Here  we propose the possible role of this potentially allogenic mimetic hormone corresponding to severe COVID19 immunopathology and illustrate that this molecular mimicry is responsible for a major pathway associated with severe disease status  Furthermore  through 3D molecular modeling and docking followed by MD simulation validation  we have unraveled the likely role of Covidin in iron dysregulation in COVID19 patients  Our metaanalysis suggests the Hepcidin mimetic mechanism is highly conserved among its host range as well as among all new variants to date including Omicron  Extensive analysis of current mutations revealed that new variants are becoming alarmingly more resistant to selective human proteases associated with host defense,",

In todays digital world, it is increasingly necessary for small business owners to embrace modern technology in order to stay competitive. Technology has empowered entrepreneurs with unprecedented access to resources and opportunities that were once only available to large companies. From simplified bookkeeping processes and improved customer service capabilities, modern technology can help provide a foundation for longterm success and growth. One key way that new technologies have enabled small businesses is through automation. Automation has made streamlining processes much simpler than before, allowing entrepreneurs more time to focus on sales or marketing strategies rather than mundane operational tasks. Software solutions like accounting programs such as Quickbooks or Salesforce CRM tools make managing finances and client relationships so much easier  freeing up valuable energy for bigger picture thinking about how best to grow the company. Since these tools also tend not to be overly expensive compared with hiring staff members just as capable at handling mundane operations, they are an extremely cost effective way for small businesses owners looking for scale their operations efficiently from home offices or virtual workspaces . Another great benefit of modern technology is increased connectivity among different stakeholders within any given organization this includes customers, partners, vendors etc. Businesses can now interact quickly across continents using email communications software like Slack while staying connected even when out of office via mobile devices In addition , cloud based storage systems enable employees in different locations simultaneously share documents without having any need exchange physical copies which saves time and reduces costs significantly . Some degree of collaboration between teams often leads better results when solving complex problems especially those related data analysis  by accessing powerful analytics tools online such as google analytics entrepreneurs obtain insights into consumer behavior which helps inform decisions around product development , marketing campaigns , pricing models etc . This kindof data driven approach allows them develop far more accurate predictions and plans future developments within their organizations leading overall increase efficiency  all thanks power computing strength accessible through internet connection. .

"As humans, we are constantly seeking ways to better ourselves and the world around us. One area that has seen incredible growth in recent years is the field of renewable energy. Renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and geothermal have revolutionized how electricity is generated and consumed around the world. The potential benefits of renewable energy are numerous from reducing dependence on finite resources like oil to providing a clean source of power for homes and businesses alike. The use of these technologies can also help reduce air pollution from burning fossil fuels which pollute our environment at an alarming rate each year. Additionally, renewable energy provides more jobs than traditional forms of power generation thanks to its rapidly growing demand for skilled technicians who install, maintain and repair systems across the globe. Despite these clear advantages over nonrenewable sources such as coal or natural gas, many people remain reluctant to adopt this type of technology due to its higher upfront costs compared with conventional sources like nuclear or coalfired plants. Even so, current trends suggest that once properly implemented through subsidies or other incentives by local governments  the longterm costs associated with using renewables often prove less expensive than their counterparts when factoring in things such as maintenance fees or infrastructure upgrades required by traditional types of power stations over time. . In conclusion, though there may be some initial hesitancy towards committing fully to utilizing renewable energies due to cost concerns  it is clear that investing in them now will reap massive rewards down the line both environmentally speaking as well as financially for those who choose this route over more obsolete methods used decades ago before modern advancements were made available todays society,",

"Since many infected people experience no or few symptoms  the SARSCoV2 epidemic is frequently monitored through massive virus testing of the population  an approach that may be biased and may be difficult to sustain in lowincome countries  Since SARSCoV2 RNA can be detected in stool samples  quantifying SARSCoV2 genome by RTqPCR in wastewater treatment plants  WWTPs  has been carried out as a complementary tool to monitor virus circulation among human populations  However  measuring SARSCoV2 viral load in WWTPs can be affected by many experimental and environmental factors  To circumvent these limits  we propose here a novel indicator  the wastewater indicator  WWI   that partly reduces and corrects the noise associated with the SARSCoV2 genome quantification in wastewater  average noise reduction of 19    All data processing results in an average correlation gain of 18  with the incidence rate  The WWI can take into account the censorship linked to the limit of quantification  LOQ   allows the automatic detection of outliers to be integrated into the smoothing algorithm  estimates the average measurement error committed on the samples and proposes a solution for interlaboratory normalization in the absence of interlaboratory assays  ILA   This method has been successfully applied in the context of Obepine  a French national network that has been quantifying SARSCoV2 genome in a representative sample of French WWTPs since March 5th 2020  By August 26th  2021  168 WWTPs were monitored in the French metropolitan and overseas territories of France  We detail the process of elaboration of this indicator  show that it is strongly correlated to the incidence rate and that the optimal time lag between these two signals is only a few days  making our indicator an efficient complement to the incidence rate  This alternative approach may be especially important to evaluate SARSCoV2 dynamics in human populations when the testing rate is low,",

"It is often said that the best things in life are free, and nothing could be truer than when it comes to the joys of spending time outdoors. With spring just around the corner, now is a great time to take advantage of all that nature has to offer. Taking outdoor walks can be incredibly beneficial for both physical and mental health, making it one of the most underrated activities available for those looking for some refreshing downtime away from their everyday lives. The benefits of walking outdoors are plentiful not only does it provide an opportunity for exercise but also a chance to observe and appreciate natures beauty up close. During a walk you get to experience all sorts of weather conditions depending on where you gofrom sunshinefilled days with blue skies and birdsong, or cool mornings with foggy mist rising from the groundeach trip will bring something unique with its own sense of tranquility and serenity that can help reset your mind after a hectic week. Even if you decide not to venture too far outside your neighborhood there are still plenty of sights worth seeing you might come across interesting wildlife like rabbits hopping by or lush flowerbeds full of bright colors hidden among trees lining streetsides. In addition, taking regular walks outside also has lots more tangible benefits such as improving cardiovascular health since walking requires concentrating effort through specific muscles over sustained periods which helps strengthen them while burning calories at the same time. According to The American Heart Association AHA, those who make sure they include 30 minutes daily brisk walking into their routine can reduce their risk factors associated with heart disease as well as managing body weight better compared people who dont walk regularly or very often. Another factor mentioned by AHA was how starting this type of activity early on in life can benefit later age groups even if overall progress isnt immediately noticeable  walking habits set during childhood may lead adults toward healthier behaviors. All these benefits make outdoor walks hard,",

"Dogs have long been a beloved companion for humans, providing unconditional love and support no matter the circumstance. It is easy to see why they are often referred to as mans best friend. As our understanding of canine psychology has deepened in recent years, research has shown that dogs can be an especially powerful tool in helping those suffering from mental health issues like depression and anxiety. This essay will explore how dogs can help improve mental health by providing companionship, physical exercise, and stress relief. For many people struggling with depression or anxiety, one of the main problems is feelings of loneliness and isolation. Dogs provide unconditional love and attention which helps to combat these feelings by giving someone a sense of connection with another living being who loves them unconditionally Having a pet also provides structure  walking the dog twice daily encourages regular activity that gives the person something positive to focus on during low moments while at home theres always someone needing your attention so you dont dwell too much on negative thoughts or emotions. The physical exercise involved in caring for a dog not only improves physical health but it can also have incredibly positive effects on mental wellbeing too Studies show that regular walks increase levels of serotonin  aka the happy hormone  which helps regulate moods reduce cortisol  aka the stress hormone  which is linked with feeling overwhelmed plus increases feelgood hormones oxytocin affection and endorphins pleasure. Walking your pup might even become part of your own selfcare routine if you find yourself able make time for it each day. . Having a furry companion around us can also work wonders when it comes reducing stress levels when life feels overwhelming. Just being near them can lower blood pressure due to its calming effect on our nervous system as well as releasing dopamine into our brains, creating an overall sense of peace  tranquility throughout any given moment regardless of what else may be going on in life ,",

"Technology has undoubtedly changed the way we communicate. With the advent of social media and smart phones, its now easier than ever to keep in touch with friends and family living around the globe. While this development has many advantages, it can also lead to communication overload and a disconnect from meaningful interactions. One area where technology is having particular impact is within relationships. Whereas once romantic partners could only talk facetoface or over landline phone calls, people now have access to a variety of tools that allow them to stay connected regardless of locationtexting, FacetimeSkype video chats, emailing, etc. On one hand this allows for more convenient communication you can send quick love notes or late night conversations without worrying about time zones or long distance charges  but on the other hand these methods are often impersonal which can make some couples feel disconnected from each other even when physically together in close proximity. Furthermore, texting and social media platforms can cause added pressure within relationships by creating false expectations related to how quickly replies should be sent back along with setting unrealistic standards of what being in touch means e.g., constantly checking up on your partner throughout the day. This type of behavior may leave one feeling as though theyre not receiving enough attention while their partners are left wondering why they dont get any peace  quiet. . In order for technologymediated communication between couples to become beneficial instead of hindering intimacy both parties must understand its pros  cons before deciding what works best for their relationship needs  whether that means engaging frequently via text messages or limiting virtual contact so as not to lose out on quality time spent together in real life settings such as dinner dates or weekend trips away from home base adding an extra bit romance.

"Not worth the effort to get in and out of construction to wait for old food.Only went there twice. The food is never fresh.  Chicken sandwich was shriveled and dry like it had been sitting for hours after being over cooked to begin with. There was a small drop of mayo on it and the bun was stale. First time I figured was a one off but the second time I ordered 20 nuggets and fries and a milkshake.  They didnt give a receipt then told me to go park to wait for the food to be ready.  There were no spots open that I could access and the cashier just said do whatever and walked away.  I waited for the car in front of me to move so I could pull around the building and get into a spot but asked first about my shake.  She said theyll bring it.  Waited a few min honestly not long but then they forgot my milkshake and asked me very curtly well do you have a receipt  clearly not.

"The global pandemic of COVID19 has attracted extensive drug searching interets for the new coronavirus SARSCoV2  Although currently several of clinically used  old  drugs have been repurposed to this new disease for the urgent clinical investigation  there is still great demand for more effective therapies for the antiinfections  Here we report the discovery that an  old  drug Emetine could potently inhibit SARSCoV2 virus replication and displayed virus entry blocking effect in Vero cells at low dose  In addition  Emetine could significantly reduce the lipopolysaccharide  LPS  induced interleukin6  IL6  protein level and moderately reduce the tumor necrosis factor  TNFalpha  protein level in the M1 polarized THP1 macrophages  In vivo animal pharmacokinetics  PK  study revealed that Emetine was enriched in the lung tissue and had a long retention time  over 12 h   With 1 mg kg single oral dose  the effective concentration of Emetine in lung was up to 1 8 muM  mice  and 1 6 muM  rats  at 12 h  which is over 200fold higher than the EC50 of the drug  The potent in vitro antiviral replication efficacy and the high enrichment in target tissue  combining with the well documented safety profiles in human indicate that low dose of Emetine might be a potentially effective antiSARSCoV2 infection therapy,",

"Objective Rates of anxiety have increased during the coronavirus disease 2019  COVID19  pandemic  partially attributable to the experience of COVID19 related concerns  It remains pivotal to determine the implications of such concerns on the severity of anxiety as they may represent opportune targets for public health preventative or therapeutic efforts  The current study evaluated COVID19 related concerns as predictors of anxiety symptom severity  It also assessed the relative risk associated with subtypes of COVID19 concerns  the role of age  sex  and minority status as potential moderators  and the unique contribution of COVID19 concerns beyond sociodemographics  perceived stress  and selfreported general mental health  Methods The data source was obtained from the publicly available  Crowdsourcing  Impacts of COVID19 on CanadiansYour Mental Health survey  conducted by Statistics Canada  Participants were Canadians aged 15 and older living in ten provinces or three territories  Only participants that completed the selfreported sociodemographics  COVID19 concerns  and general anxiety symptoms measures were included  n   44549   Multivariate linear regression was used to evaluate continuous reports of anxiety symptoms  and the relative risk of meeting anxiety cutoff levels was determined using chisquare nonparametric testing  Results Within the sample  29 1  met cutoff levels of anxiety  Levels of coping and security  R 2    0 205  p  0 001   distal  R 2    0 043  p  0 001   and proximal concerns  R 2    0 122  p  0 001  were found to predict the severity of anxiety experiences  which was determined to be robust to statistical control for sociodemographics  perceived stress and selfreported general mental health  DeltaR 2    0 0625  p  0 001   Minority status and sex were significant moderating variables  although the interaction accounted for less than 0 1  of the observed variance  Family stress from confinement  support during and after the crisis and personal health concerns significantly predicted more than a 200  increase in the risk of meeting anxiety cutoff levels  Conclusion The current study represents a novel examination of COVID19related concerns as risk factors for the experience of anxiety amongst a sizeable Canadian cohort  Coping and securityrelated concerns represented robust predictors of anxiety symptom experiences  Participants who experienced concerns relating to their proximal social groups were two times more at risk for meeting cutoff anxiety levels than individuals without such concerns  Longitudinal and evidence synthesis remains essential for identifying therapeutic targets and developing pandemicrelated public health prevention and care,",

"Unlike many of the worlds most beautiful places, the Caribbean island of Barbados is often overlooked. The lush tropical landscape, whitesand beaches and warm, crystal clear waters make it an ideal destination for anyone looking to escape the hustle and bustle of everyday life. From its vibrant culture to its rich history, Barbados has something for everyone. Barbados boasts a variety of outdoor activities within its boundaries that appeal to all types of travelers. Nature lovers will revel in snorkeling or surfing along one of the many beaches dotting the coastline while adventure seekers can take part in exciting water sports such as kiteboarding and banana boat rides. Hikers are sure to be enthralled by vast trails which traverse through jungles filled with abundant wildlife. For those who prefer a more leisurely experience, there are plenty of opportunities for sightseeing such as Harrisons Cave  a captivating limestone cavern adorned with breathtaking stalagmites and stalactites  or Bridgetowns historic Garrison district full of old colonial structures from centuries past. The island also offers up an unforgettable cultural experience due largely in part to its diverse population composed mostly descendants from African slaves brought over during British colonization as well as some Indian influences derived from indentured servants at this time period too.

"The Benefits of Living in a Coastal Town. Living in a coastal town can be an enriching experience, connecting people to the beauty of nature and giving them access to many activities. For starters, living near the coast means having endless possibilities for recreational activities. From swimming and surfing in the waves, or exploring tide pools for hours on end, life by the sea is full of adventure. Not only does it provide entertainment but also helps with overall physical health as well as mental wellbeing. Another great benefit of living in a coastal town is that there are ample opportunities to observe wildlife up close. Whether its watching dolphins frolic around while fishing offshore or spotting sea turtles while strolling along the beach at low tide  these moments create lifelong memories that cannot be replicated elsewhere. Its easy to appreciate how delicate yet powerful our oceans are when theyre right outside your front door every day. . In addition to its natural resources, being situated within proximity of shorelines provides easier access to ports and seaside towns all over the world Many cities located near coasts tend have larger populations than those inland because this form transportation makes life easier for both citizens and businesses alike no longer do we have to rely solely upon landbased travel from one place to another  ships have opened up routes throughout history that made global communication much more efficient. This has given rise not only trade but also cultural exchange between countries which was previously impossible before ships had been invented. . Last but certainly not least  coastal towns possess some truly breathtaking views as far as sunsets go The colors created by light reflecting off water droplets never cease amaze even longtime residents who know them like old friends each evening brings something new with vibrant oranges and pinks dancing across their horizon while birds soar above peacefully completing any view into paradise itself. So if you want bragging rights about where you live then nothing beats calling yourself a resident coastaltowner,",

From vibrant colors and shapes to the sense of enchantment they bring upon those who witness them, rainbows have been admired by people all over the world since ancient times. In modern days, many professionals opt to specialize in capturing these stunning marvels with their cameras or lenses. Rainbow photography has become a profession that involves a great deal more than simply pointing and shooting. Photographers must understand how light works and its effects on different landscapes to be able to capture these phenomena properly. For example, understanding the science behind how colors are refracted by droplets in the atmosphere during storms allows photographers to predict when rainbow sightings will occur which increases their chances for success dramatically. They also need knowledge about camera settings like exposure time, aperture size and ISO control as well as basic composition skills such as balance and contrast if they want beautiful rainbow shots that stand out from other pictures taken at the same moment in time. Knowing how weather affects color saturation is also critical clouds can diminish brightness while excessive moisture can make rainbows appear faded or washed out due to too much humidity in the air around them. Lastly, patience is essential often times photographers have to sit through several downpours before finally witnessing one of natures most spectacular displays first hand With enough practice though anyone passionate about capturing this unaltered beauty can gain access into this exciting field of photography. No matter what type of lens used or environment explored, gazing up at swirling arcs bridging between heaven and earth never fails to leave observers stunneda feeling only intensified tenfold when experienced through photographs skillfully composed by dedicated rainbow hunters,",

"Most people dont realize the importance of bees in our everyday lives. Bees are essential for pollinating plants and flowers, which helps produce the food that we eat and also encourages a vibrant and diverse ecosystem. Unfortunately, due to habitat destruction, pesticide use, climate change, as well as other factors such as urbanization and disease outbreaks bee populations have been declining rapidly around the world. The decline in bee numbers is concerning because it affects not only our environment but also us directly. Pollinators are responsible for onethird of all crop production worldwide so without them there would be an enormous decrease in available food sources globally. Additionally, honeybees provide a host of other benefits such as producing honey or wax used for candles or cosmetics. Therefore if we want to ensure our continued access to these resources its important that we make efforts to protect them now before their numbers dwindle even further than they already have. There are numerous ways we can help preserve bee populations from supporting organizations who focus on protecting bees through research projects or through donations avoiding pesticides when possible planting wildflowers rich with nectar building shelters like nesting boxes for solitary bees advocating policy changes at local levels to create more suitable habitats for bees and doing our best to educate ourselves about their plight so that others will become aware too. Ultimately preserving bee populations has many advantages both short term and long term so taking action towards this goal is vital if we want future generations to continue enjoying the incredible benefits provided by these amazing creatures,",

"Although it might seem like a small detail, recycling is an important part of helping to protect the environment. Recycling helps reduce landfill waste and pollution, conserve resources, and create jobs. As more people become aware of the importance of reducing their environmental impact on the planet, individuals have begun to take action by increasing their personal efforts towards recycling. Recycling involves separating materials such as paper, plastic bottles or containers, glass jars or cans from regular garbage and collecting them for reuse in various ways. By reusing these items instead of throwing them away into landfills where they can remain for centuries without breaking down or decomposing completely , we are able to save energy and preserve our natural resources while also helping to reduce air and water pollution caused by manufacturing plants that produce new products using raw materials found in nature. Additionally, proper recycling reduces greenhouse gases emitted during production processes as well as those produced when materials break down in landfills. Furthermore, recycling creates jobs for local communities because processing recyclable material requires human labor which provides employment opportunities this contributes positively to economic growth within affected areas. Moreover, many businesses are now engaging in green practices that promote sustainability through increased use of reusable packaging materials . These initiatives not only help decrease carbon emissions but also provide additional job openings related directly or indirectly with ecofriendly operations . For example The Coca Cola Company has recently announced its commitment to creating a World Without Waste  this global campaign seeks not just better methods for managing waste but also improved approaches toward constantly replenishing natural resources used throughout the beverage industry supply chain process . In conclusion , although most people often overlook the value associated with proper recycling , its benefits should not be underestimated  it helps preserve our planets limited resources while simultaneously providing economic advantages at both local and international levels . Therefore it is up us all  governments , corporations ,and individuals alike to take meaningful action towards making sustainable choices every day that will ultimately help,",

"The Internet has revolutionized the way that we communicate, learn and work. It is no exaggeration to say that the world wide web has been a transformative force in our lives. Although it was only introduced in 1969, its effects have had farreaching implications for many industries, from media and entertainment to education and commerce. In this essay I will explore how the internet has specifically impacted online shopping trends over the past decade. Before the introduction of ecommerce sites such as Amazon or eBay, buying goods could be quite a hassle requiring trips to physical stores or catalogs with limited selection options. However, with just a few clicks of your mouse you can now access hundreds of thousands of products from around the world at competitive prices  all without leaving your home This sudden change in convenience meant more time saved for customers who would otherwise have to drive out to purchase what they need not to mention money saved on gas. Apart from ease of purchase, online shoppers also benefit from greater variety when it comes to product selection due largely in part thanks to globalization allowing us access foreign markets which couldnt previously be accessed by most consumers locally. This means even niche items are available for those who know where exactly where look  resulting in increased choice for everyone involved. . Additionally, online retailers often provide discounts through promotional codes or offers exclusive deals which arent available elsewhere  further incentivizing buyers into making their purchases via digital platforms instead traditional methods such bricksandmortar locations or mail order catalogs . Moreover unique payment options like PayPal allow users additional safety measures while shopping along side convenient account tracking features so you may easily keep track off what you buy. . The emergence of new technologies such mobile phones and tablets have made purchasing goods even simpler With modern smartphones being equipped with sophisticated barcode scanning apps  browsing favorite shops becomes considerably easier than before , opening up entirely new avenues towards retail efficiency within seconds  Furthermore social media platforms like Facebook,",

"A recent study published in the Journal of American Medical Association found that intermittent fasting can have a positive effect on health and wellbeing. Intermittent fasting is defined as short periods of voluntary abstinence from food, either completely or partially, for multiple days at a time. The research conducted examined the effects of alternate day fasting ADF among obese individuals over the course of 24 weeks. The results showed that participants who followed an ADF diet experienced greater weight loss than those consuming daily caloric restriction diets. In addition, those who practiced ADF had greater reductions in waist circumference and body fat percentage compared to those following daily caloric restriction diets. Furthermore, there were no major adverse events reported in any groups throughout the duration of study which suggests that this type of eating plan may be safe for many people looking to improve their overall health through dietary changes. Intermittent fasting has gained popularity as more people are becoming aware of its potential benefits such as improved metabolic markers and increased energy levels due to reduced calorie intake during fasted states. It is important to note however that this form of eating should only be undertaken after consulting with a healthcare professional to ensure it fits into an individuals lifestyle and goals safely when combined with other methods such as exercise, nutrition education and behavioral modification therapy if needed. . Although further research needs to be done on the longterm effects intermittent fasting has on various populations before firm conclusions can be drawn about its efficacy for weight management, these initial findings offer some promising evidence that alternating between periods with restricted calories and periods with unrestricted calories could potentially lead to improved overall health outcomes for certain individuals looking for alternative approaches towards successful weight management plans .,",

"The importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle cannot be overstated. Eating right, exercising regularly and getting enough sleep are all integral components of leading a healthy life. By making small changes in our daily habits we can see big results in the future when it comes to our overall health and wellbeing. A balanced diet is essential for achieving optimal nutrition and health benefits. Eating meals that are high in lean proteins, complex carbohydrates, dietary fiber, vitamins and minerals will help us stay energized throughout the day while also preventing chronic illnesses such as heart disease or diabetes later on in life. Fruits and vegetables should make up about half of what we consume each day, with whole grains making up another quarter portion followed by lowfat dairy products and fish containing omega3 fatty acids rounding out the remaining quarter portion for a complete nutritional profile. Additionally, drinking plenty of water is important for flushing toxins from your body as well as helping you maintain an ideal weight range so that you dont become overweight or obese which can lead to other medical complications down the line if left unchecked. Regular exercise not only helps us keep fit but it also releases endorphins which can improve moods decrease stress levels reduce anxiety increase energy levels promote better sleep quality build muscle strength boost immunity against diseases like colds or flus enhance cognitive performance enabling sharper focus along with higher productivity at work or school related tasks  lower blood pressure keeping arteries clear  strengthen bones reducing risk of fractures due to osteoporosis etc. Varying types of physical activity including aerobic exercises heart rate raising activities, resistance training strengthening muscles as well as flexibility drills stretching  mobility should all be incorporated into weekly workout routines for full benefit to be realized on multiple fronts connected to ones physical being . .

"BACKGROUND  Wearable devices can diagnose  monitor  and manage neurological disorders such as Parkinson disease  With a growing number of wearable devices  it is no longer a case of whether a wearable device can measure Parkinson disease motor symptoms  but rather which features suit the user  Concurrent with continued device development  it is important to generate insights on the nuanced needs of the user in the modern era of wearable device capabilities  OBJECTIVE  This study aims to understand the views and needs of people with Parkinson disease regarding wearable devices for disease monitoring and management  METHODS  This study used a mixed method parallel design  wherein survey and focus groups were concurrently conducted with people living with Parkinson disease in Munster  Ireland  Surveys and focus group schedules were developed with input from people with Parkinson disease  The survey included questions about technology use  wearable device knowledge  and Likert items about potential device features and capabilities  The focus group participants were purposively sampled for variation in age  all were aged 50 years  and sex  The discussions concerned user priorities  perceived benefits of wearable devices  and preferred features  Simple descriptive statistics represented the survey data  The focus groups analyzed common themes using a qualitative thematic approach  The survey and focus group analyses occurred separately  and results were evaluated using a narrative approach  RESULTS  Overall  32 surveys were completed by individuals with Parkinson disease  Four semistructured focus groups were held with 24 people with Parkinson disease  Overall  the participants were positive about wearable devices and their perceived benefits in the management of symptoms  especially those of motor dexterity  Wearable devices should demonstrate clinical usefulness and be userfriendly and comfortable  Participants tended to see wearable devices mainly in providing data for health care professionals rather than providing feedback for themselves  although this was also important  Barriers to use included poor hand function  average technology confidence  and potential costs  It was felt that wearable device design that considered the user would ensure better compliance and adoption  CONCLUSIONS  Wearable devices that allow remote monitoring and assessment could improve health care access for patients living remotely or are unable to travel  COVID19 has increased the use of remotely delivered health care  therefore  future integration of technology with health care will be crucial  Wearable device designers should be aware of the variability in Parkinson disease symptoms and the unique needs of users  Special consideration should be given to Parkinson diseaserelated health barriers and the users  confidence with technology  In this context  a usercentered design approach that includes people with Parkinson disease in the design of technology will likely be rewarded with improved user engagement and the adoption of and compliance with wearable devices  potentially leading to more accurate disease management  including selfmanagement,",

"The importance of protecting coral reefs cannot be overstated. They are some of the most biodiverse ecosystems in the world, often providing essential habitats for a variety of marine species including fish, mollusks and crustaceans. Coral reefs also contribute to coastal protection by buffering wave action, promoting shoreline stability and sheltering coastlines from storms and erosion. Unfortunately, however, these underwater formations are facing grave threats due to human activities that can significantly damage their structure or even completely destroy them altogether. One major factor threatening coral reef health is climate change rising ocean temperatures can cause corals to expel living symbiotic algae zooxanthellae from their tissues which results in coral bleaching  turning them white as they starve without food sources. This process leaves corals vulnerable to disease leading in many cases to complete death of affected colonies if conditions do not improve quickly enough. In addition acidification caused by increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide has been linked with reduced calcification rates among stony corals resulting in slower growth or even dissolution of structures depending on local water chemistry conditions. Overfishing is another key threat impacting the sustainability of coral reefs it removes important prey species such as fish that graze on harmful algal blooms keeping these populations under control while simultaneously reducing available food sources for predators like sharks and sea turtles who rely upon them for sustenance. Furthermore bottom trawling used by commercial fisheries causes excessive amounts physical disturbance damaging delicate seabed communities as well as uprooting live organisms like sponges which form important parts within reef systems themselves contributing substantially towards biodiversity and increasing productivity within this environment . . It is thus clear why there needs to be more stringent regulation put into place both nationally and internationally so as better protect our precious coral reefs before further irreversible harm is inflicted upon them or worse still they disappear entirely never again detectable except through memories or photographs taken before any destruction ever occurred at all unfortunately,",

"The use of technology in the classroom is increasingly becoming a mainstay in todays educational environment. With more advanced tools being made available to teachers and students, it has become much easier for educators to engage learners with interactive activities that can help them better retain information. By utilizing tablets, laptops, and other devices such as smart boards, teachers are able to create an effective learning experience that goes beyond traditional methods of instruction. One of the major benefits associated with using technology in the classroom is its ability to simplify complex tasks. Teachers can use intuitive software programs or applications to explain difficult concepts, break down problems into smaller steps, and provide realtime feedback on assignments or projects. This makes it easier for students who may have trouble understanding certain material since they can interact with it at their own pace without feeling overwhelmed by large amounts of content all at once. Additionally, this kind of personalized support helps reduce time spent providing oneonone tutoring outside class time which allows instructors more freedom when creating class curriculum or assigning work. Another great advantage from incorporating digital elements into education stems from its collaborative potential across various disciplines. In many cases where multimedia elements are used as part of coursework such as animations illustrating scientific principles, classmates can easily discuss topics together while also viewing visuals that make these ideas come alive instead of having a single person attempt to explain abstract theories orally without any supportive visuals available as backup material. Not only does this make mitigating disagreements simpler but also encourages creative thinking since everyone involved will be actively attempting to connect different ideas together through group discussion rather than just solving isolated problems on their own which could lead towards stagnation if repetition occurs too often over prolonged periods of time . . Lastly , integrating technology into classrooms not only increases student engagement levels but also serves as an incentive for educational institutions looking for ways improve their overall efficiency . Many schools now look towards implementing online courses , setting up virtual labs , and expanding their digital libraries so they can reach larger audiences both locally and,",

"Background  Patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome are mainly treated with continuous positive airway pressure  Polysomnographyguided fullnight manual titration is the gold standard for continuous positive airway pressure titration  but it is cost  time  and effortconsuming  Alternative ways of titration are easier with less cost  time  and effort  In the era of the COVID19 pandemic  the need to establish more safe strategies is increased  Aim  To choose a rapid  efficient  simple  and safe method with less effort and cost in the measurement of a suitable level of positive airway pressure in the management of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome  Methods  This study enrolled 48 adult patients who had been diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome at our sleep unit and were candidates for treatment with continuous positive airway pressure according to AASM 2008 after exclusion of other sleeprelated breathing disorders  All patients underwent both laboratory fullnight manual titration and autotitration  by Prisma20A of WEINMANN medical technology  Germany   Manual titration pressure and P95 of autotitration were obtained and compared with calculated pressures by five predictive formulas  Miljeteig and Hoffstein  Series  Stradling  Loredo  and Lee   Results  Patients included in the study were 25 females  52 1   and 23 males  47 9   with a mean  SD of age of 49 98  10 36 years  Mean  SD of manual pressure was 10 44  2 49 cmH2O  P95 was 10 16  2 64 cmH2O  and calculated pressures by different equations were  Miljeteig and Hoffstein  8 53  2 03  Series  11 40  1 81  Stradling  9 68  1 65  Loredo  9 90  1 79  and Lee  10 61  2 68 cmH2O  No significant differences were reported between manual pressure and pressures of autotitration with Series  Stradling  Loredo  and Lee equations  p 0 112  0 09  0 212  0 213  and 0 657  respectively   Conclusion  Autotitration can be used as an effective alternative to manual titration with less cost and effort and is more comfortable to patients  Predictive formulas can be used instead of standard and autotitration especially in resourcelimited facilities and in pandemics,",
"The COVID19 pandemic outbreaks forced families to decide the safest and most effective learning environments for their children because of the virus s threat to health and life  Hence  because of the nationwide school closure  policymakers have raised concerns about the missing children casesthose who have not enrolled in school at all because of the pandemic  The present study investigates whether there is a difference in the school enrollment during the preCOVID19 period  COVID19 period  and vaccine rollout period  We employed the U S  Current Population Survey  CPS   covering January 2020 to May 2021  while we use both the logistic and multinomial regression models for the empirical analysis  Our results showed that school enrollment is lower during the COVID19 pandemic compared to the PreCOVID19 period  Other results showed that school enrollment is higher since vaccine rollout compared to the COVID19 period  A possible explanation for this could be that families consider the vaccine the safe path to enrolling their children in school  We also found that school enrollment varies significantly across race and ethnic groups,",
"PURPOSE  This study aims to provide new knowledge on the relative importance of key life domains amongst older adults  and how the Coronavirus pandemic has influenced their life  domain  satisfaction  METHODS  A crosssectional survey was administrated to an online panel of the general public aged 65 years and older in Australia from 28 April to 26 May 2020  Life satisfaction was measured by the Personal Wellbeing Index  PWI  including both global life satisfaction and life domain satisfaction   A discrete choice experiment technique was used to elicit how respondents perceive the relative importance of six key life domains drawn from the PWI  standard of living  health  relationships  safety  community connectedness  and future security  RESULTS  A total of 1 056 respondents  53  female  with a mean  range  age of 73  6591  years old completed the survey  After controlling for a rich set of confounding factors  regardless of the choice of overall life satisfaction indicators  there were consistent findings that the strongest negative influence of COVID19 on life domains and decrements on life satisfaction was for Personal Health  Personal Relationships and Standard of Living  The DCE data revealed that all six life domains were statistically significant in contributing to a better life  and there exists some preference heterogeneity between those who perceived no impact versus negative impacts from COVID19  CONCLUSIONS  From both revealed and stated preference data there was robust evidence that health  relationships  and standard of living represent the three most important life domains for older adults in Australia,",

"Its no secret that computers have become an integral part of our lives. But this technology is not only useful for work and entertainment activities it can also be used to help alleviate difficult social problems. Homelessness is one such area in which computer technology has tremendous potential to provide much needed assistance. Computerbased systems have been designed specifically to assist those without permanent housing, allowing homeless individuals the ability to access vital resources quickly and easily. By providing an easy way for people to find nearby shelters, food banks, counseling services, job placement programs and more with just a few clicks or taps on a mobile device, these systems can give homeless individuals access to care they may not otherwise receive due to transportation barriers or even lack of awareness about available options. Furthermore, since information regarding service availability is constantly changing due to funding issues or other factors, computerbased systems are equipped with builtin mechanisms that allow users and administrators alike stay uptodate on whats available at any given time in their community. In addition, many of these computerized systems also offer special features such as interactive maps that make searching for local services easier by highlighting nearby sites visuallya great benefit if youre unfamiliar with your surroundingsor even automated alerts that remind users when their next appointment after intake screenings is coming up so they dont miss out on important appointments related receiving aid from government agencies like Social Security Administration SSA. All of these capabilities make it possible for vulnerable populations who may otherwise struggle accessing necessary services get the help they need quickly and effectively. Computer technology has already begun changing how we approach homelessness as a society hopefully its continued development will bring us closer towards finding lasting solutions for this critical issue in the future.,",

"When faced with a seemingly insurmountable task, its easy to become overwhelmed and feel like giving up. But for those passionate about learning the guitar, there are some tips to help break through this barrier. Learning how to play the guitar is an immensely rewarding experiencenot only can it be incredibly fun to do but also has lifelong benefits in terms of cognitive development and selfesteem. To start off on your guitar playing journey, youll need a few key items a good quality instrument either acoustic or electric, picks, strings, strap and tunermetronome. Its important that you get these things right as they will make all the difference in your learning process later on Once you have your gear sorted out then comes practice  something which requires dedication and commitment if you want meaningful results. One of the best ways for new players to learn their craft is by finding online tutorials or lessons from experienced teachers  these can provide structured guidance throughout each step of learning which helps build confidence quickly. Additionally, dont be afraid to reach out in person either  look around local music stores or universities who may offer individual teaching sessions suited specifically towards beginners take advantage of any family members who might know how to play enlist friends into forming an informal band environment where you all learn together All of these options will provide great support networks while simultaneously pushing yourself beyond what feels comfortable initially  essential for comprehensive musical growth over time.

"Texting while driving has become a rampant issue in modern society, endangering both drivers and innocent bystanders. While the dangers of texting while driving are wellknown, far too many people still take the risk every day. The statistics behind texting and driving paint an alarming picture of how pervasive this activity is  more than 30 of all car accidents involve cell phone use, with 21 involving text messaging specifically. That adds up to 3 thousand deaths per year resulting from distracted driving alone, not to mention hundreds of thousands more injuries each year due to phones taking priority over safety on the road. Texting behind the wheel can be as dangerous as impaired or reckless driving because it takes eyes and attention off the road for long periods at a time. The consequences that come from being caught texting while operating a vehicle can vary greatly depending on where you live however they usually include hefty fines or even jail time in extreme cases. This combined with potential civil liability if someone is hurt could result in tremendous costs incurred by those who choose to ignore such laws out of carelessness or negligence. The best way to prevent such costly mistakes is simply avoiding any usage whatsoever when behind the wheel hands free options exist for those times when talking on your phone cannot wait until you reach your destination safely. Ultimately, no matter what state we live in or how tough its penalties may be  following these laws should not only be done out of respect for life but also financial sensibilities as well preventing yourself from becoming one more statistic means protecting your wallet along with everything else,",

I get that, I really do.  But they ALWAYS post signs and notices so youre not blindsided by it.  Not this place.  I really dont think they were closed.

Its always sorry, ice cream machine is broken if you come in after the lobby closes.The worst part is I complained on the website.

"OBJECTIVES  Nursing homes  NHs  are important health care and residential environments for the growing number of frail older adults  The COVID19 pandemic highlighted the vulnerability of NHs as they became COVID19 hotspots  This study examines the associations of NH design with COVID19 cases  deaths  and transmissibility and provides relevant design recommendations  DESIGN  A crosssectional  nationwide study was conducted after combining multiple national data sets about NHs  SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS  A total of 7785 NHs were included in the study  which represent 50 8  of all Medicare and or Medicaid NH providers in the United States  METHODS  Zeroinflated negative binomial models were used to predict the total number of COVID19 resident cases and deaths  separately  The basic reproduction number  R0  was calculated for each NH to reflect the transmissibility of COVID19 among residents within the facility  and a linear regression model was estimated to predict log R0  1   Predictors of these models included community factors and NHs  resident characteristics  management and rating factors  and physical environmental features  RESULTS  Increased share of private rooms  larger living area per bed  and presence of a ventilatordependent unit are significantly associated with reductions in COVID19 cases  deaths  and transmissibility among residents  Increased number of certified beds in the NH is associated with reduced resident cases and deaths  after setting the number of actual residents as the exposure variable and controlling for staff cases  It also correlates with reduced transmissibility among residents when other risk factors  including staff cases  are controlled  CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS  Architectural design attributes have significant impacts on COVID19 transmissions in NHs  Considering the vulnerability of NH residents in congregated living environments  NHs will continue to be highrisk settings for infection outbreaks  To improve safety and resilience of NHs against future health disasters  facility guidelines and regulations should consider the need to increase private rooms and living areas,",

"Administration of AstraZeneca Oxford and Johnson   Johnson Janssen Covid19 vaccines which use an adenovirus vector for DNA delivery has been associated with very rare thromboembolic complications coupled with an immune response to platelet factor 4 protein  The cause of this has not yet been identified  It is known that binding of coagulation factor proteins to the surface of some adenoviruses can protect their function  Here I propose that the thromboembolic events are caused by impairment of coagulation factor X binding to the virus capsid  The unprotected capsid then stimulates an immune response leading to platelet activation  increased thrombogenicity and formation of an antibody complex with platelet factor 4  Impaired binding of factor X may be due to an undiagnosed mutation in affected individuals  Options to test this mechanism experimentally and potential remedial actions to resolve the hazard are described  This mechanism offers a remedial route to address concerns about the safety of these vaccines  which are otherwise wellpositioned to deliver global Covid19 immunity across diverse healthcare economies,",

"In todays society, few topics are as important or controversial as the ethics of animal testing. Animal testing is a practice used in scientific research by which animals are subjected to various experiments for the purpose of understanding complex biological processes. Many people believe that animal testing should be banned altogether due to its inherent cruelty and ethical implications, while others argue that its necessary for medical progress. However, both sides can agree on one thing proper regulation of animal testing is critical if it must continue. In order to understand why regulation is so essential when it comes to animal testing, we first have to look at why scientists use animals in their experiments in the first place. The primary reason behind this practice lies with the fact that animals share many similar physiological systems and genetic makeup with humans thus making them ideal test subjects for studies into new treatments and medicines aimed at helping better human health outcomes. Scientists also use animal models because they are cheaper than conducting clinical trials directly on humans and provide more control over variables such as diet and environment  something impossible with human test subjects who have individual external factors affecting their health. The issue arises when standards governing these tests arent properly maintained by researchers or institutions performing them  resulting in unacceptable levels of unnecessary suffering inflicted upon animals being tested upon without any meaningful benefit gained from their ordeal. To prevent this situation from occurring again, there needs to be stricter regulations surrounding how these tests are conducted including closer monitoring of research protocols used during experiments by external organizations such as government agencies. Additionally, emphasis must also be placed on further reducing our reliance on live animal experimentation through increased investment towards alternative methods such as computer simulations or 3D tissue cultures where possible  allowing us to still gain access to vital medical knowledge without having perform unethical practices on living creatures needlessly. Allinall, although there may not always be an easy way forward when addressing ethical issues related to practices like animal testing finding ways ensure humane treatment for our,",

"On 24th March 2020  the first nationwide complete lockdown was announced by the Prime Minister of India for 21 days which was later extended to 31st May 2020  Consequently  thousands of migrant workers placed in big cities had no other option but to go back to their native villages  Their journeys back to villages thousands of kilometres on bicycles or foot due to the nonavailability of public transport amidst the travel ban were driven by the compulsions of food and shelter  In one of many heartwrenching incidents  sixteen laborers were run over by a freight train  all passenger trains in the wake of lockdown had been halted  while they were resting on the railway tracks  The images of the Roti  Indian bread  on the railway track strewn across were beamed on the national news channels  as a telling commentary of the unimaginable hardships of these workers  Ironically  in the eyes of law  they were trespassers under the Indian Railways Act  1989  The Indian Railway did not pay any compensation to the victims  Their act also violated the Indian Disaster Management Act  2005 and Indian Penal Code  1860 the law for the breach of lockdown guidelines and the law for disobedience of order by public servants respectively for having decided to travel amidst a travel ban  The semiotics of lawmaking acts  criminal  bereft of  moral culpability  are seldom questioned on their supposed amoral foundations  Pandemic exhibited that social fissures not only condition the individual or community actions but also the actions of the State  Minorities especially Muslims were at the receiving end of State s selective enforcement of lockdown laws in India  The various instances in the wake of the COVID19 pandemic expose the hollow claims of equality before the law and the equal protection of laws as a constitutional promise to every citizen  This article aims to unravel the ostensible and the actual moral exhibition of such Indian laws through the lens of several incidents during the nationwide lockdown in India  This paper would argue that this constructed positivist amorality needs to be deconstructed to unearth the power imbalance that it seeks to hide,",
"Due to the microvascular effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARSCoV2   head and neck reconstructive surgeries utilizing free tissue transfers may be profoundly affected by SARSCoV2 infection in the immediate postoperative period  Our objective is to describe two adult patients who developed SARSCoV2 after undergoing relatively uncomplicated segmental mandibulectomies  In both cases  the patients were initially negative for SARSCoV2  underwent relatively uncomplicated segmental mandibulectomies with fibula free flap reconstructions  and were later discharged in stable conditions  Both patients subsequently experienced significant infectious sequelae at the donor and recipient sites with neartotal splitthickness skin graft loss in the donor sites in the setting of postoperative SARSCoV2 infection  The first patient developed sepsis and gangrenous changes to his fibula donor site requiring four operative debridements and partial amputation with subsequent osteomyelitis of the remaining fibula  The second patient experienced dehiscence of the oral fibula free flap as well as a 22 cm phlegmon at the fibula donor site that required surgical debridement  In consideration of these cases  SARSCoV2 infection during the immediate postoperative period of head and neck reconstruction procedures may elevate the risk of major wound complications  Special consideration must be taken when performing free tissue transfers during the COVID19 pandemic,",

"In the era of open data  Poisson and other count regression models are increasingly important  Still  conventional Poisson regression has remaining issues in terms of identifiability and computational efficiency  Especially  due to an identification problem  Poisson regression can be unstable for small samples with many zeros  Provided this  we develop a closedform inference for an overdispersed Poisson regression including Poisson additive mixed models  The approach is derived via modebased logGaussian approximation  The resulting method is fast  practical  and free from the identification problem  Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate that the estimation error of the proposed method is a considerably smaller estimation error than the closedform alternatives and as small as the usual Poisson regressions  For counts with many zeros  our approximation has better estimation accuracy than conventional Poisson regression  We obtained similar results in the case of Poisson additive mixed modeling considering spatial or group effects  The developed method was applied for analyzing COVID19 data in Japan  This result suggests that influences of pedestrian density  age  and other factors on the number of cases change over periods,",

"BACKGROUND  Excess mortality captures the total effect of the Coronavirus Disease 2019  COVID19  pandemic on mortality and is not affected by misspecification of cause of death  We aimed to describe how health and demographic factors were associated with excess mortality during  compared to before  the pandemic  METHODS AND FINDINGS  We analysed a time series dataset including 9 635 613 adults    40 years old  registered at United Kingdom general practices contributing to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink  We extracted weekly numbers of deaths and numbers at risk between March 2015 and July 2020  stratified by individuallevel factors  Excess mortality during Wave 1 of the UK pandemic  5 March to 27 May 2020  compared to the prepandemic period was estimated using seasonally adjusted negative binomial regression models  Relative rates  RRs  of death for a range of factors were estimated before and during Wave 1 by including interaction terms  We found that allcause mortality increased by 43   95  CI 40  to 47   during Wave 1 compared with prepandemic  Changes to the RR of death associated with most sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were small during Wave 1 compared with prepandemic  However  the mortality RR associated with dementia markedly increased  RR for dementia versus no dementia prepandemic  3 5  95  CI 3 4 to 3 5  RR during Wave 1  5 1  4 9 to 5 3   a similar pattern was seen for learning disabilities  RR prepandemic  3 6  3 4 to 3 5  during Wave 1  4 8  4 4 to 5 3   for black or South Asian ethnicity compared to white  and for London compared to other regions  Relative risks for morbidities were stable in multiple sensitivity analyses  However  a limitation of the study is that we cannot assume that the risks observed during Wave 1 would apply to other waves due to changes in population behaviour  virus transmission  and risk perception  CONCLUSIONS  The first wave of the UK COVID19 pandemic appeared to amplify baseline mortality risk to approximately the same relative degree for most population subgroups  However  disproportionate increases in mortality were seen for those with dementia  learning disabilities  nonwhite ethnicity  or living in London,",

"OBJECTIVES  This study investigated trends in hospitaltreated selfharm and hospital presenting suicidal ideation in the period before and after COVID19 public health responses by key sociodemographic groups among those presenting to hospitals in the Western Sydney  Australia  population catchment  METHODS  Emergency department presentations for the period January 2016 to June 2021 were used to specify a series of interrupted timeseries models to compare the observed and expected event rates of  1  hospitaltreated selfharm and  2  hospital presenting suicidal ideation in the period following the onset of COVID19 public health measures in March 2020  Rate differences between observed and expected rates in the postimplementation period were also estimated in models stratified by sex  age group  country of birth and socioeconomic status  RESULTS  There was no significant increase in hospitaltreated selfharm in the period postimplementation of public health orders  March 2020  compared to the previous period  although there were lower than expected rates of emergency department presentations among nonAustralianborn males  males aged 014 years and 2544 years  and females aged 4564 years  In contrast  there was a significant increase in hospital presenting suicidal ideation  particularly among women  rate difference per 100 000   3 91  95  confidence interval    1 35  6 48   and those aged 1524 years  both males and females  rate differences ranging from 8 91 to 19 04   and among those residing in lower socioeconomic status areas  both males and females  rate differences ranging from 0 90 to 2 33   CONCLUSION  There was no increase in hospitaltreated selfharm rates in the 15 months postimplementation of COVID19 public health orders in Western Sydney  however  there was a significant increase in hospital presenting suicidal ideation  The limited change in suicidal behaviour may reflect the success of social and economic supports during this period  the benefits of which may have been different for young people  and those of lower socioeconomic status,",
"BACKGROUND  The COVID19 pandemic has led to an avalanche of scientific studies  drawing on many different types of data  However  studies addressing the effectiveness of government actions against COVID19  especially nonpharmaceutical interventions  often exhibit data problems that threaten the validity of their results  This review is thus intended to help epidemiologists and other researchers identify a set of data issues that  in our view  must be addressed in order for their work to be credible  We further intend to help journal editors and peer reviewers when evaluating studies  to apprise policymakers  journalists  and other research consumers about the strengths and weaknesses of published studies  and to inform the wider debate about the scientific quality of COVID19 research  RESULTS  To this end  we describe common challenges in the collection  reporting  and use of epidemiologic  policy  and other data  including completeness and representativeness of outcomes data  their comparability over time and among jurisdictions  the adequacy of policy variables and data on intermediate outcomes such as mobility and mask use  and a mismatch between level of intervention and outcome variables  We urge researchers to think critically about potential problems with the COVID19 data sources over the specific time periods and particular locations they have chosen to analyze  and to choose not only appropriate study designs but also to conduct appropriate checks and sensitivity analyses to investigate the impact s  of potential threats on study findings  CONCLUSIONS  In an effort to encourage high quality research  we provide recommendations on how to address the issues we identify  Our first recommendation is for researchers to choose an appropriate design  and the data it requires   This review describes considerations and issues in order to identify the strongest analytical designs and demonstrates how interrupted timeseries and comparative longitudinal studies can be particularly useful  Furthermore  we recommend that researchers conduct checks or sensitivity analyses of the results to data source and design choices  which we illustrate  Regardless of the approaches taken  researchers should be explicit about the kind of data problems or other biases that the design choice and sensitivity analyses are addressing,",

"Time travel is a concept that has intrigued people since the dawn of human civilization. From stories of ancient gods to modern science fiction, humankind has always been fascinated by the thought of visiting other eras and times. While some might think time travel is only possible in books or movies, there have been many scientific advancements made over the years that suggest otherwise. In fact, recent research indicates that true time travel could be more than just a farfetched notion it may soon become reality. One potential method for achieving time travel involves manipulating spacetime curves with wormholes or stargates. These theoretical cosmic passages would theoretically allow us to move through different points in both space and time simultaneously if manipulated correctly. While this idea remains highly speculative at present, scientists are actively researching ways for us to make use of these principles in practical applications. Another option being studied extensively is using powerful lasers as propellants for spacecrafts traveling faster than light speed FTL. This method would theoretically slow down our perception of time relative to those around us due to Einsteins theory of relativityallowing us to experience events from past eras without actually moving through them physically. However, while this approach holds promise, technological limitations still impede its development significantly at present. In addition to these two approaches currently being researched by scientists worldwide, advances in quantum physics hold out hope for even greater breakthroughs in the realm of temporal manipulation when used together with existing technology such as nanotechnology and computer simulation software. The possibilities here range from creating miniature versions of ourselves that exist across multiple points in both space and time simultaneously quantum cloning all the way up to potentially controlling elements within an entire event timeline itself All exciting possibilities indeedif we get it right. . Regardless which approach eventually proves successful thoughor whether new ones arise along the wayit seems clear at least one thing will remain unchanged humans curiosity about what lies ahead throughout history wont be going,",
"INTRODUCTION  South America is one of the regions most affected by the COVID19 pandemic  Specific and affordable treatments are needed to treat SARSCoV2 infection  Evidence regarding the use of convalescent plasma in COVID19 patients is still limited  We compared the safety and efficacy of COVID19convalescent plasma administration as a complement to standard treatment in the early management of patients with moderate SARSCoV2 infection  METHODS  We carried out a random double blinded  placebocontrolled trial that compared standard treatment plus convalescent plasma  CP  or plus nonconvalescent plasma in the management of COVID19 patients  The main outcome was survival and secondary endpoints included  length of hospitalisation  LOH   days from treatment to discharge  time to clinical improvement or death within a 28day period  and adverse reactions to treatment  RESULTS  Administration of CP with antibodies against SARSCoV2 did not affect patient survival  RR   1 003  95  CI  0 3938  2 555   These results led to terminate the RCT prematurely  However  early treatment of COVID19 patients with CP tended to decrease the LOH while the delay in CP treatment was associated with longer hospitalisation  In addition  delay in CP treatment negatively affected the recovery of the respiratory rate  CONCLUSION  Use of CP for the treatment of COVID19 patients is safe and its early use can decrease the LOH and improve respiratory function  Early administration of antibodyrich CP could contribute to decrease the negative impact of COVID19 pandemic in patients with impaired immune response,",

"Are the Benefits of Eating Organic Food Worth the Price Organic food has become increasingly popular in recent years due to increasing awareness of its potential health benefits. While organic food typically carries a higher price tag than conventionalproduce, there are numerous advantages that often make it well worth the investment. The first benefit is that organic foods are healthier for both people and animals. They are grown without any pesticides or chemicals, which can be harmful when ingested by humans or livestock. Additionally, organic produce is often richer in essential vitamins and minerals due to being grown under more natural conditions without relying on artificial fertilizers or other harsh chemicals used in conventional farming methods. Furthermore, studies have also shown that some organically raised fruits and vegetables may contain higher levels of antioxidants than their conventionally farmed counterparts since they do not need as many chemical additives during growth cycles. Another advantage of eating organic food is that it does not harm the environment as much as conventional farming methods do. Pesticides and chemicals used on nonorganic crops can leach into rivers, lakes, ground water sourcescontaminating habitats and harming local wildlife populations in addition to reducing soil fertility over time because these substances kill off beneficial microorganisms present within the soil structure necessary for healthy plant growth cycles. In contrast, organic agriculture relies mostly on animal manure composting instead of synthetic fertilizers so no toxins enter nearby waterways plus crop rotation helps maintain long term soils fertility naturally with minimal disruption to delicate ecosystems even over multiple seasons harvests. . Finally, purchasing organic products supports sustainable agricultural practices like crop diversification which reduces biodiversity loss associated with monocroppingthese results in greater sustainability overall while helping small farmers stay afloat by providing them with an alternative income source outside corporate agribusiness models where prices tend to drop significantly after one harvest season passes thus leaving them unable to make money off their crops before they go bad quickly due lack demand caused by low market prices,",

For many people, these activities provide more than just entertainment they offer solace in times of hardship or stress. As an avid dancer myself, I can personally attest to the power that comes with stepping into the studio and letting my mind wander through movement. The feeling of fully trusting your body as you move around the space is unparalleled  each step filled with emotion and intent behind it. The sensation of expressing yourself physically, telling stories both subtle and grandiose within moments dedicated solely to yourself is truly liberating. Watching as your muscles react instinctively at every turn brings about a sense accomplishment when reflecting upon how far you have come since beginning this journey weeks ago  all while having fun along the way. But theres more than just physicality when it comes to performing arts theres also camaraderie among participants which makes dancing especially powerful in its ability to bring people together regardless of their backgrounds or abilities on stage Everyone works towards becoming stronger artists collectively as well as individually so we can best represent ourselves on stage during shows or competitions  creating memories that will last long after we stop moving our feet across floors everywhere. Whether teaching others who are just starting out themselves or learning from someone elses experiences, this formative experience evokes heartwarming emotions throughout countless communities today  allowing them to take away valuable lessons inside and outside rehearsal halls too. From providing stress relief after school hours or getting us ready for auditions ahead ballet will always continue being one important activity whether experienced recreationally like me  or professionally by those aspiring dancers looking forward towards success down the line And although participating in any form art requires focus  dedication especially if done seriously it should never be considered tedious work  but rather enjoyable given everything possible that can been,",

"BACKGROUND  Over the past two decades there has been significant research linking inflammatory bowel disease  IBD  to depression  The chronicity of symptoms coupled with the financial burden of treatment costs  missed days of work school and interpersonal relationship stress are contributing factors in the diagnosis of depression  The prevalence of depression within the IBD community is 15  and depressive symptoms are noted in 20  of patients  Furthermore  IBD patients with severe uncontrolled disease have higher rates of depression  40 7   than those in remission  16 5    The association between IBD and depression is linked to lower quality of life  poor medication compliance  worse disease outcomes  increased hospitalization  and higher suicidal risk  Early diagnosis and treatment of depression in IBD patients is paramount in achieving and maintaining IBD disease remission  While the association between IBD and depression is wellknown  identifying depression can be a challenge  Review of recent literature shows that depression is under screened in IBD clinics  We present a prospective quality improvement study at a robust IBD center evaluating the impact of a validated depression screen  PHQ9  on identifying depression compared to standard of care  METHODS  We compared the prevalence of depression in the IBD clinic in the control group using the history and diagnosis of depression and compared it against the intervention group after HQ9 screening  Control group patient data was collected from June 2020 to July 2020 via virtual and in person visits  Intervention group PHQ9 data was collected in person visits from January  March 2020 and postintervention data collection was placed on hold until November 2020 due to the COVID pandemic  One randomly selected patient from each clinic session was asked to participate in the study at the time of visit  The primary end point was to compare the rates of depression and identify any barriers in providing early treatment for depression  The secondary endpoint was to identify high risk patients that are prone to depression  Categorical variables were analyzed by chi square analysis or fischer exact tests  Numerical data were analyzed using Ttest  RESULTS  A total of 111 patients were screened  60 patients were randomized to the control group  i e  EMR based review for depression  and 51 patients were screened via survey during in person clinic visit  The identified depression rate from control vs intervention group is 20  vs  35   p   0 071   Rates of depression were 15  in nonfistulizing Crohn s disease vs  41 4  in fistulizing Crohn s disease  p   0 003   Multivariate model for predicting depression noted to be significant for extraintestinal manifestations OR of 3 06  1 03  9 12  p   0 045 and age OR of 0 97  0 94  1 00  p   0 042  Control vs  intervention identification of depression in patients with extraintestinal manifestations is notable for OR of 3 31  1 15  9 52  p   0 026 in the univariate model and OR of 3 30  1 07  10 16  p   0 038 in the multivariate model  CONCLUSION  Key findings including identification of depression is higher in the intervention group compared to the control group  Though the data is not statistically significant  this is likely secondary to the small sample size in the setting of the pandemic  In addition  univariate analysis revealed a statistically significant finding that the older the age of the patient  the less likely they are to have depression  Our data showed that the mean age of depressed patients was 38 3 compared to nondepressed patients whose mean age is 47 1  Further analysis can help elucidate this finding  for example identifying if older patients are being treated for depression or more likely to seek out therapists compared to younger patients  Univariate analysis also revealed that intestinal Crohn s disease was a risk factor for depression  This is possibly secondary to the severity of disease in these individuals  especially if their IBD is causing an impact on their quality of life  Looking into the number of hospitalizations  days off from work or school  and coexisting medical diagnoses can allow us to further understand if depression stems from their disease  Given preliminary findings  we plan to continue this study for a larger sample size and further determine if there is a significant delay in identifying depression with the current standard of care,",

"BACKGROUND  Several studies indicate that COVID19 is primarily transmitted within indoor spaces  Therefore  environmental characterization of SARSCoV2 viral load with respect to human activity  building parameters  and environmental mitigation strategies is critical to combat disease transmission  METHODS  We recruited 11 participants diagnosed with COVID19 to individually occupy a controlled chamber and conduct specified physical activities under a range of environmental conditions  we collected human and environmental samples over a period of three days for each participant  RESULTS  Here we show that increased viral load  measured by lower RNA cycle threshold  CT  values  in nasal samples is associated with higher viral loads in environmental aerosols and on surfaces captured in both the near field  1 2 m  and far field  3 5 m   We also found that aerosol viral load in far field is correlated with the number of particles within the range of 1 microm 2 5 microm  Furthermore  we found that increased ventilation and filtration significantly reduced aerosol and surface viral loads  while higher relative humidity resulted in lower aerosol and higher surface viral load  consistent with an increased rate of particle deposition at higher relative humidity  Data from near field aerosol trials with high expiratory activities suggest that respiratory particles of smaller sizes  0 3 microm 1 microm  best characterize the variance of near field aerosol viral load  CONCLUSIONS  Our findings indicate that building operation practices such as ventilation  filtration  and humidification substantially reduce the environmental aerosol viral load  and therefore inhalation dose  and should be prioritized to improve building health and safety,",

"Background  Individuals infected with the COVID19 virus present with different symptoms of varying severity  In addition  not all individuals are infected despite exposure  Risk factors such as age  sex  and comorbidities play a major role in this variability  however  genetics may also be important in driving the differences in the incidence and prognosis of the disease  An Insertion Deletion  I D  polymorphism in the ACE1 gene  rs1799752  may explain these genetic differences  The aims of this study were to determine the potential role of ACE1 I D genetic polymorphism in the risk of contracting COVID19 as well as predicting the severity of COVID19 infection  Methods  Threehundred and eightyseven nonrelated Lebanese subjects  155 controls and 232 cases  who presented to the American University of Beirut Medical Center  AUBMC  for COVID19 PCR testing were recruited  Clinical data were collected via filling a questionnaire and accessing the medical records  Peripheral blood was withdrawn for DNA isolation  and genotyping performed with standard PCR followed by band visualization on agarose gel  Results  In our study population  previously described risk factors such as gender  age  and comorbidities were associated with increase in disease susceptibility and severity  ACE1 I was the least common allele  and there was a positive association between ACE1 I and the risk of contracting the COVID19 disease  More specifically  the frequency of II genotype was significantly higher among cases when compared to controls  P   0 035  with individuals with the II genotype having greater risk for contracting the COVID19 disease  OR   2 074  P   0 048 in the multivariate analysis  As for disease severity  the DD genotype and D allele were associated with increased risk for developing severe symptoms  OR   2 845  P   0 026 and OR   2 359  P   0 014  respectively   and the DD genotype with necessitating hospitalization  OR   2 307  P   0 042   In parallel  D allele carriers showed a significantly increased risk for developing hypoxia  OR   4 374  P   0 045  Conclusion  We found a positive association between ACE1 I and the risk of contracting the COVID19 disease  and between ACE1 D and a worse outcome of the COVID19 infection  Therefore  genotyping for ACE1 I D polymorphism could be used to assess risk and predict severity for better prognosis and management of the disease,",

"The importance of a good nights sleep in achieving academic success cannot be overstated. Sleep deprivation can have a serious negative impact on our physical and mental health, as well as our ability to perform academically. For this reason, it is vital that students understand the benefits of getting enough rest each night and make an effort to prioritize their sleep. Studies show that people who get adequate amounts of quality sleep tend to experience improved concentration levels and better overall grades than those who are chronically deprived. This is because when we are able to fully recharge through restful slumber, we can think more clearly and process information more quickly than when we are running on empty. Therefore, making sure you get at least seven hours of uninterrupted sleep per night will pay dividends for your academic performance by boosting your alertness and memory retention during class or while studying for exams. In addition to these cognitive benefits, proper sleep also plays an important role in aiding the bodys natural healing processes so that it can cope with any physical demands placed upon it throughout the day  whether theyre due to long lectures or rigorous sports matches. As such, allowing yourself time every evening for good quality shuteye helps reduce fatigue later down the line which may prevent burnout caused by overexertion from lack of restorative downtime. Finally, spending too much time trying to cram knowledge into our brains will likely result in decreased productivity due not just to feeling exhausted but also having trouble concentrating for extended periods without succumbing to distraction or boredom  something especially true when attempting complex tasks like essay writing Adequate rest prepares us mentally for times requiring higher level thinking so investing in good sleeping habits now could save a lot of frustration further along down the road when deadlines fast approach. . All things considered then dont underestimate how beneficial obtaining sufficient nightly repose can be towards ones success both inside and outside the classroom Achieving academic excellence requires careful planning out all,",

"The world of mathematics is one that has been studied and explored for centuries. From its earliest beginnings in ancient times to its modern-day applications, math has shaped the way we think about the universe. Mathematics can be seen as a language with which we communicate about relationships, patterns, quantities and shapes. It is also used to solve problems that arise in everyday life and in every field of human endeavor from science to engineering to business. At its core, math involves equations that describe mathematical relations between numbers or variables such as geometry or calculus. It helps us understand how things work by breaking down complex ideas into simpler ones which can then be applied more broadly across a wide range of disciplines. For example, algebra plays an important role in understanding stock market trends or predicting weather patterns while calculus helps us comprehend physical laws governing energy levels or forces operating on objects like planets and stars. In addition, mathematics also enables us to appreciate the beauty hidden within seemingly random phenomena  fractals come alive when looked at through a mathematical lens. On top of all this utility math's also gives us an opportunity to explore abstract concepts such as infinity which many find captivating even though they may not understand it thoroughly at first sight what could be more beautiful than contemplating something beyond our comprehension Whether we use it for practical purposes or admire it out of curiosity  math remains integral part of our lives and will continue so long as the quest for knowledge exists among humans,",

"When it comes to the topic of the importance of a good education, few would deny its significance in todays society. Education has long been heralded as one of the key foundations for success and is commonly viewed as being essential for career growth and financial stability. However, there are many other aspects about having a good education that go beyond simply making money or earning a degree it also helps individuals develop intelligent skillsets required for independent decision making, practical problem solving and effective communication. At its core, getting an education should not be focused on solely obtaining credentials but rather on gaining knowledge to become an informed member of society. A quality educational system will equip students with fundamental skills such as critical thinking abilities, analytical capabilities and research techniques needed to succeed in any field they chose to pursue. It is important that these skills are developed early so they can be further honed throughout their academic journey leading up to college or university where more specialized courses may be taken depending on individual career aspirations. In addition to providing students with intellectual developmental experiences, receiving a good education also helps instill values that can assist them through daily life no matter what job path they choose later down the line. These include traits like personal responsibility which may include time management when tackling tasks at hand or developing an understanding for working collaboratively with peers despite differences in opinion towards certain topics or issues. Selfconfidence is another trait essential from school aged children all the way into adulthood if one lacks confidence during their formative years this can lead them onto paths littered with selfdoubt instead of taking risks which could potentially pay off big time later down line either professionally or personally speaking . . Ultimately when looking at all factors pertaining towards why someone should strive for achieving a quality educational experience it becomes abundantly clear why this pursuit deserves recognition in our current world climate both tangible benefits such as monetary return along side intangible benefits like emotional development cannot be overlooked when considering how much work goes into getting even just basic schooling,",

"SARSCoV2 vaccination is known to induce antibodies that recognize also variants of concerns  VoCs  of the virus  However  epidemiological and laboratory evidences indicate that these antibodies have a reduced neutralization ability against VoCs  We studied binding and neutralizing antibodies against the Spike protein domains and subunits of the WuhanHu1 virus and its alpha  beta  delta VoCs and of seasonal betacoronaviruses  HKU1 and OC43  in a cohort of 31 health care workers prospectively followed postvaccination with BNT162b2Comirnaty  The study of sequential samples collected up to 64 days postvaccination showed that serological assays measuring IgG against WuhanHu1 antigens were a poor proxy for VoC neutralization  In addition  in subjects who had asymptomatic or mild COVID19 prior to vaccination  the loss of nAbs following disease could be rapid and accompanied by postvaccination antibody levels similar to those of naive vaccinees  Interestingly  in health care workers naive for SARSCoV2 infection  vaccination induced a rapid and transient reactivation of preexisting seasonal coronaviruses IgG responses that was associated with a subsequent reduced ability to neutralize alpha and beta VoCs,",
"The coronavirus disease 2019  COVID19  which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2  SARSCoV2  is consistently causing profound wounds in the global healthcare system due to its increased transmissibility  Currently  there is an urgent unmet need to identify the underlying dynamic associations among COVID19 patients and distinguish patient subgroups with common clinical profiles towards the development of robust classifiers for ICU admission and mortality  To address this need  we propose a four step pipeline which   i  enhances the quality of multiple timeseries clinical data through an automated data curation workflow   ii  deploys Dynamic Bayesian Networks  DBNs  for the detection of features with increased connectivity based on dynamic association analysis across multiple points   iii  utilizes Self Organizing Maps  SOMs  and trajectory analysis for the early identification of COVID19 patients with common clinical profiles  and  iv  trains robust multiple additive regression trees  MART  for ICU admission and mortality classification based on the extracted homogeneous clusters  to identify risk factors and biomarkers for disease progression  The contribution of the extracted clusters and the dynamically associated clinical data improved the classification performance for ICU admission to sensitivity 0 83 and specificity 0 83  and for mortality to sensitivity 0 74 and specificity 0 76  Additional information was included to enhance the performance of the classifiers yielding an increase by 4  in sensitivity and specificity for mortality  According to the risk factor analysis  the number of lymphocytes  SatO2  PO2 FiO2  and O2 supply type were highlighted as risk factors for ICU admission and the percentage of neutrophils and lymphocytes  PO2 FiO2  LDH  and ALP for mortality  among others  To our knowledge  this is the first study that combines dynamic modeling with clustering analysis to identify homogeneous groups of COVID19 patients towards the development of robust classifiers for ICU admission and mortality,",

"Playing a team sport is an important part of growing up. Whether its baseball, basketball, soccer, or any other organized game, the benefits of being on a team far outweigh any negatives. Team sports teach children vital skills that will help them in life such as teamwork and communication. They also provide motivation and camaraderie while keeping kids physically active and healthy. Team sports allow children to learn valuable lessons about working together toward a common goal. Learning how to communicate effectively with teammates can be difficult for some kids but it is an essential skill that carries into adulthood when dealing with coworkers and family members alike. Being part of a team teaches trust between individuals which in turn strengthens the bond within each groupbuilding lasting relationships along the way. Plus theres nothing quite like winning games together as a team after weeks of hard work. Playing organized sports also helps keep kids physically fit and healthy while having fun at the same time. Exercise releases endorphins which are known to boost mood so playing any kind of sport provides physical activity combined with an emotional outletsomething that may not be found elsewhere in daytoday life for young children who dont get enough exercise from school or home activities alone. Physical health isnt just about looking good staying active helps build bone strength and reduces inflammation in muscles which can prevent injury later on down the road too. . Finally, joining a youth league gives many kids something positive to look forward to every week during their formative yearsand plenty of bragging rights when they win championships Theres no greater feeling than learning new things from coaches or even peers while making lifelong friends through shared experiences on the field or courtwhich will likely remain memorable moments long after they stop playing competitively altogether. . In conclusion, participating in team sports offers untold benefits for all involved improved communication skills with others better physical fitness increased mental wellbeing as well as stronger bonds between,",

"When it comes to the topic of high school sports, there is no doubting their importance in many peoples lives. Not just for developing physical prowess and discipline, but also for providing a platform from which those aspiring to excel can launch themselves into postsecondary study or professional opportunities. For this reason, it is essential that high schools take full advantage of the potential these programmes have to offer. At its core, participation in high school sports provides both students and coaches with an outlet not only to improve their physical abilities through physically challenging activities but also develop important life skills such as communication, teamwork and problem solving. This combination of factors helps participants build strong relationships with classmates while acquiring knowledge that could prove invaluable when applying for college or university programs or pursuing a career path after graduation. In order for schools to capitalise on these benefits however, adequate resources must be allocated towards ensuring teams are well supported so they can reach their maximum potential without compromising anyones safety nor academic progress being too hindered by sporting commitments. One way this can be achieved is by allowing pupils ample training time throughout the year where dedicated coaches can help guide them towards meeting future goals while maintaining acceptable levels of performance at schoolwork something which needs regular monitoring if expected outcomes are going to be reached  especially during peak seasons when competition becomes particularly fierce. . Supporting athletes goes beyond simply equipping them with necessary tools though proper nutrition and rest should also form part of every curriculum since exhaustion caused by overtraining often has serious consequences on overall health both mentally  physically speaking Hydration breaks beforeafter practice sessions should become routine along with yearly checkups conducted by qualified medical professionals making sure each member obeys all safety regulations set out within national guidelines for participating sports. .

"BACKGROUND  Despite the fact that the clinical efficacy of hydroxychloroquine is still controversial  it has been demonstrated in vitro to control SARSCoV2 multiplication on Vero E6 cells  In this study  we tested the possibility that some patients with prolonged virus excretion could be infected by less susceptible strains  METHOD  Using a highcontent screening method  we screened 30 different selected isolates of SARSCoV2 from different patients who received azithromycin    hydroxychloroquine  We focused on patients with viral persistence  i e   positive virus detection in a nasopharyngeal sample   10 days  and who were tested during two French epidemic waves  late winterspring of 2020 and the summer of 2020  Doseresponse curves in singlemolecule assays with hydroxychloroquine were created for isolates with suspected reduced susceptibility  Genome clustering was performed for all isolates  RESULTS  Of 30 tested strains  three were detected as replicating in the presence of azithromycin   hydroxychloroquine  each at 5 muM  The doseresponse model showed a decrease in susceptibility of these three strains to hydroxychloroquine  Whole genome sequencing revealed that these three strains are all from the second epidemic wave and two cluster with isolates from Africa  CONCLUSIONS  Reduced susceptibility to hydroxychloroquine was not associated with viral persistence in nasopharyngeal samples  Rather  it was associated with occurring during the second epidemic wave  which began in the summer and with strains clustering with those with a common genotype in Africa  where hydroxychloroquine was the most widely used,",

"As technology continues to advance, so too do the advances in artificial intelligence AI. AI is a rapidly evolving field that has already had an immense impact on society and will continue to have far more effects as time goes on. This essay will explore how AI can be used for better decisionmaking, automation of tasks, and improving quality of life. Decisionmaking is arguably one of the most important activities any human being engages in its integral to our survival. Unfortunately, we dont always make the best decisions due to inherent biases or limited knowledge. By using AI algorithms such as machine learning or deep learning models, people are able to make more informed decisions by utilizing vast amounts of data gathered from sources around the world. Furthermore, these systems are able to adapt over time by optimizing themselves based on their environment and experiences  something humans cannot do effectively with current technologies available today. The ability for machines and computers to take over tedious tasks has been a dream since its inception dating back hundreds of years ago when automatons were invented by Leonardo da Vinci himself With advancements in computing power and development in programming languages such as Python and Java Scripts this goal is beginning become reality through automation tools like Robotic Process Automation RPA. These tools allow companies automate mundane jobs once completed manually which not only saves valuable resources but also leads greater efficiency overall while freeing up employees time for higher value work. Over time these tools are expected improve even further leading towards full automation across all types fields including finance, retail sales etc. Finally theres no denying that Artificial Intelligence has significantly improved quality life both inside outside work environments ranging from virtual assistants helping ease communication between individuals households or intelligent medical procedures catching diseases early before they turn into serious health issues later down line just few examples benefits this technology offers us currently. In future however possibilities seem limitless concerning what could achieved with proper utilization latest developments society itself could potentially see major improvements,",

"In the summer of 2021  European governments removed most NPIs after experiencing prolonged second and third waves of the COVID19 pandemic  Most countries failed to achieve immunization rates high enough to avoid resurgence of the virus  Public health strategies for autumn and winter 2021 have ranged from countries aiming at low incidence by reintroducing NPIs to accepting high incidence levels  However  such high incidence strategies almost certainly lead to the very consequences that they seek to avoid  restrictions that harm people and economies  At high incidence  the important pandemic containment measure  testtraceisolatesupport  becomes inefficient  At that point  the spread of SARSCoV2 and its numerous harmful consequences can likely only be controlled through restrictions  We argue that all European countries need to pursue a low incidence strategy in a coordinated manner  Such an endeavour can only be successful if it is built on open communication and trust,",

"OBJECTIVE  Our hospital experienced a hospital shutdown and quarantine for two weeks after one case of COVID19 was diagnosed during hospitalization  We analyzed the reopening process following hospital closure and possible factors that prevented hospital spread  METHODS  We retrospectively reviewed the confirmed patient s medical records and results of epidemiological survey available from the infection control team of our hospital  RESULTS  A total of 117 hospital staff members were tested  26 of whom were selfisolated  Of the 54 inpatients tested  28 on the same floor and two close contacts in the endoscopic room were quarantined in a single room  Finally  all quarantined hospital staff  inpatients and outpatients were tested for COVID19 on the 14th day of close contact  The results were all negative  and the hospital work completely resumed  CONCLUSION  Although closing and isolating the hospital appeared to have played a useful role in preventing the spread of COVID19 inside the hospital and to the local community  it is still debated whether or not the duration of hospital closure or quarantine was appropriate  The lessons from the twoweek hospital closure suggest that wearing a mask  hand hygiene and the ward environment are important factors in preventing nosocomial outbreaks of COVID19,",
"The concept of time management is something that has been discussed and debated for centuries. While the exact definition of what it means to effectively manage your time can vary depending on individual needs and goals, there are a few fundamental principles that hold true for everyone looking to maximize productivity in both their personal and professional lives. At its core, effective time management requires organizing tasks into manageable chunks so you can fulfill all your obligations without sacrificing quality or feeling overwhelmed. One way to begin developing an effective time management strategy is by creating a daily schedule that outlines the activities you need to complete throughout the day. Start with listing out your major tasks such as work hours, classes and any other scheduled commitments then fill in more specific priorities like errands and chores underneath those items. Additionally, make sure you also include breaks into this plan so that you dont end up burned out by overworking yourself too much  these will help ensure that not only do necessary items get done but also allow room for selfcare activities like exercise or leisure reading so you remain healthy and happy during this process. . Another important part of successful time management lies in learning how to prioritize tasks efficiently while many people default to simply going through their list from top to bottom regardless of importance, taking some extra moments at the start of each week or day will save precious minutes later when it comes down crunchtime mdash compare deadlines with effort required, prioritize accordingly This can be especially beneficial if youre juggling multiple projects at once since focusing on one thing at a time allows us greater concentration mdash thus enabling better outcomes than if we try tackling everything simultaneously and potentially becoming overwhelmed. Finally, dont forget about setting realistic goals for yourself too mdash having ambitious objectives is great but pacing yourself appropriately will lead towards more successful attainment over longer periods rather than burning out immediately after starting something new. . . . .

"The power of social media cannot be understated. In todays world, it has become one of the most powerful tools for connecting people and allowing them to spread their message far and wide. While some may view this as a negative, there is much that can be done with social media to benefit society in many different ways. One of the most important uses for social media is its ability to help create movements and bring attention to important issues that might otherwise go unnoticed. This can range from environmental causes such as climate change or animal conservation, all the way through to political activism such as advocating for human rights or more democratic reforms in various countries around the globe. For instance, campaigns like MeToo have seen huge success due largely in part because of their presence on popular platforms like Twitter and Facebook which allowed them to reach so many people. Social media also provides an invaluable platform for marginalized voices who are looking for a space where they feel safe speaking out about topics that often get overlooked by mainstream outlets. Through hashtags like BlackLivesMatter and countless other similar initiatives, these voices are able create an audience willing listen and understand what they have been going through without judgement or prejudice attached  something which would not have been possible before this technology existed at scale level we see now daytoday basis across the worlds population . Overall, while there may indeed be some negatives associated with using social media cyberbullying being just one example, it is clear that if used wisely it can be hugely beneficial both on an individual level but even more so when considering how powerful its potential reach could truly be when harnessed correctly by those with positive intentions at heart . Social Media has already had a dramatic impact on our lives so far let us hope that future generations make use of this incredible tool responsibly moving forward into new age technology,",

"BACKGROUND  SARSCoV2  the causative agent of COVID19 pandemic is a RNA virus prone to mutations  Formation of a stable binding interface between the Receptor Binding Domain  RBD  of SARSCoV2 Spike  S  protein and AngiotensinConverting Enzyme 2  ACE2  of host is pivotal for viral entry  RBD has been shown to mutate frequently during pandemic  Although  a few mutations in RBD exhibit enhanced transmission rates leading to rise of new variants of concern  most RBD mutations show sustained ACE2 binding and virus infectivity  Yet  how all these mutations make the binding interface constantly favourable for virus remain enigmatic  This study aims to delineate molecular rearrangements in the binding interface of SARSCoV2 RBD mutants  RESULTS  Here  we have generated a mutational and structural landscape of SARSCoV2 RBD in first six months of the pandemic  We analyzed 31 403 SARSCoV2 genomes randomly across the globe  and identified 444 nonsynonymous mutations in RBD that cause 49 distinct amino acid substitutions in contact and noncontact amino acid residues  Molecular phylogenetic analysis suggested independent emergence of RBD mutants  Structural mapping of these mutations on the SARSCoV2 Wuhan reference strain RBD and structural comparison with RBDs from batCoV  SARSCoV  and pangolinCoV  all bound to human or mouse ACE2  revealed several changes in the interfacial interactions in all three binding clusters  Interestingly  interactions mediated via N487 residue in clusterI and Y449  G496  T500  G502 residues in clusterIII remained largely unchanged in all RBD mutants  Further analysis showed that these interactions are evolutionarily conserved in sarbecoviruses which use ACE2 for entry  Importantly  despite extensive changes in the interface  RBDACE2 stability and binding affinities were maintained in all the analyzed mutants  Taken together  these findings reveal how SARSCoV2 uses its RBD residues to constantly remodel the binding interface  CONCLUSION  Our study broadly signifies understanding virushost binding interfaces and their alterations during pandemic  Our findings propose a possible interface remodelling mechanism used by SARSCoV2 to escape deleterious mutations  Future investigations will focus on functional validation of insilico findings and on investigating interface remodelling mechanisms across sarbecoviruses  Thus  in long run  this study may provide novel clues to therapeutically target RBDACE2 interface for pansarbecovirus infections,",

"Background  In a previous study  we demonstrated that the accumulation of parenting stress during prolonged school closures and restrictions on daily activities due to the COVID19 pandemic in Japan indicates the need for mental health intervention for parents at higher risk of parenting stress  However  few studies have focused on parenting stress in other Asian countries  although they have experienced higher numbers of infections  The aim of the present study was to investigate whether parenting stress among caregivers increased across Asia due to school closures and restrictions on activities during the COVID19 pandemic and to examine whether there were any countryspecific  crosscountry  or crossregional risk factors for increased parenting stress  Methods  We conducted an online survey immediately after the number of new cases in India significantly increased  SeptemberNovember 2020   We measured parenting stress  anxiety  and fear associated with the COVID19 crisis  as evaluated by the Parenting Stress Index  ShortForm  PSISF   and the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale  CAS   across three Asian countriesIndia  n   142   Malaysia  n   69   and Japan  n   182 in addition to the United States  n   203   We also investigated whether respondents had adverse childhood experiences  ACE  as a risk factor for parenting stress  Results  For all countries  we found significant increases in participants  current parenting stress levels  compared to what they recalled regarding their lives before COVID19related restrictions and school closures were enacted  Textual analysis qualitatively identified common terms related to parenting stress across all countries  We also found a statistical model that indicated ACE in parents was a critical risk factor for higher parenting stress via increasing anxiety and fear related to the pandemic  Conclusion  These results indicate the need to improve the mental health of caregivers who are at risk for higher levels of parenting stress during the COVID19 pandemic in Asian countries as well as Western countries  These results indicate that there is a need to improve the mental health of caregivers who are at risk for higher levels of parenting stress during the COVID19 pandemic globally,",

"Seventeen years after the epidemic of SARS coronavirus  a novel coronavirus SARSCoV2emerged resulting in an unprecedented pandemic  Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2  ACE2  is an essential receptor for cell entry of SARSCoV2 as well as the SARS coronavirus  Despite many similarities to SARS coronavirus  SARSCoV2 exhibits a higher affinity to ACE2 and shows higher infectivity and transmissibility  resulting in explosive increase of infected people and COVID19 patients  Emergence of the variants harboring mutations in the receptorbinding domain of the Spike protein has drawn critical attention to the interaction between ACE2 and Spike and the efficacies of vaccines and neutralizing antibodies  ACE2 is a carboxypeptidase which degrades angiotensin II  B1bradykinin  or apelin  and thereby is a critical regulator of cardiovascular physiology and pathology  In addition  the enzymatic activity of ACE2 is protective against acute respiratory distress syndrome  ARDS  caused by viral and nonviral pneumonias  aspiration  or sepsis  Upon infection  both SARSCoV2 and SARS coronaviruses downregulates ACE2 expression  likely associated with the pathogenesis of ARDS  Thus  ACE2 is not only the SARSCoV2 receptor but might also play an important role in multiple aspects of COVID19 pathogenesis and possibly postCOVID19 syndromes  Soluble forms of recombinant ACE2 are currently utilized as a panvariant decoy to neutralize SARSCoV2 and a supplementation of ACE2 carboxypeptidase activity  Here  we review the role of ACE2 in the pathology of ARDS in COVID19 and the potential application of recombinant ACE2 protein for treating COVID19,",

"The COVID19 pandemic has dramatically demonstrated the importance of labor to supply chain network activities from production to distribution with shortfalls in labor availability  for numerous reasons  resulting in product shortages and the reduction of profits of firms  Even as progress has been made through vaccinations  issues associated with labor are still arising  Increasing wages is a strategy to enhance labor productivity and  also to ameliorate  in part  labor shortages  but has not  until this work  been explored in a full supply chain network context  Specifically  in this paper  a game theory supply chain network model is constructed of firms competing in producing a substitutable  but differentiated  product  and seeking to determine their equilibrium product path flows  as well as hourly wages to pay their workers  under fixed labor amounts associated with links  and wageresponsive productivity factors  The theoretical and computational approach utilizes the theory of variational inequalities  We first introduce a model without wage bounds on links and then extend it to include wage bounds  Lagrange analysis is conducted for the latter model  which yields interesting insights  as well as an alternative variational inequality formulation  A series of numerical examples reveals that firms can gain in terms of profits by being willing to pay higher wages  resulting in benefits also for their workers  as well as consumers  who enjoy lower demand market prices for the products  However  sensitivity analysis should be conducted to determine the range of such wage bounds  Ultimately  we observed  that the profits may decrease and then stabilize  This work adds to the literature on the integration of concepts from economics and operations research for supply chain networks and also has policy implications,",

"The fascinating history and culture of the Arabian Peninsula has long been a source of fascination for many travelers. From its vibrant metropolitan cities to its untouched desert oases, it provides an enchanting experience like no other destination in the world. A trip to the Arabian Peninsula can provide visitors with a unique opportunity to delve deep into the mysteries of this enigmatic region. The earliest inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula were nomadic tribes who migrated from Mesopotamia thousands of years ago. Over time, these tribes became known as bedouins and settled down in various parts of what is now Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Kuwait and Oman. Although they lived off their herds and practiced subsistence farming techniques, they also developed sophisticated trading networks that allowed them to travel across large distances in search of goods such as spices and perfumes. This trade network also enabled cultural exchange between different communities leading to a rich diversity within Arab society today which includes Arabs from both North Africa as well as Gulf states such as Qatar or Bahrain. Another remarkable feature about life on the Arabian Peninsula are its extravagant traditional markets called souks where locals gather together each day for shopping entertainment or just hanging out with friends . The products sold there range from colorful fabrics and exotic spices to intricate jewelry pieces that signify trustworthiness among considerate individuals making these souks not only vibrant places but also centers for social interaction . Throughout centuries past , these souks have been an integral partof daily life allowing people to express themselves through art performance music negotiationand storytelling  all while bargaining over items purchased at market stalls. From camel riding experiences across vast sand dunes surrounded by golden sunsets ,to meditating atop ancient ruins  visiting holy sites like Mecca Medina or Jeddahs Red Sea port camping under starlit skies filled with constellations unknown anywhere else a visit to any corner on this unique land will leave you mesmerized Moreover one cannot go without mentioning some amazing gastronomic delicacies served up at,",

"BACKGROUND  All events in Europe  including EURO2020 football championship  were postponed due to Covid19 in 2020  Instead  Euro2020 took place in 2021  as mitigation measures were relaxed  crosscountry mobility increased  and the Delta variant was spreading across Europe  This study explored the possibility of an increased Covid19 spread across Europe following EURO2020 matches  METHODS  Covid19 data on cases  vaccination and delta variant for participating countries  host cities regions and neighboring countries  for May till July 2021  were obtained from European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control  Our World in Data  Johns Hopkins COVID19 Dashboard and the UK Government website  EURO2020 data was obtained from the UEFA official website  RESULTS  A general increase in Covid19 positivity trend in Europe was observed following a week of EURO2020 matches across most countries and host cities  A similar trend was observed for the Delta variant sample positivity rate  The increased incidence was mostly among the young generation  49 years   A decline in positive cases was observed on a national level for most countries following the Finals match  CONCLUSION  The EURO2020 was an anticipated mass sports event  and it was the firsttime spectators were allowed to enter stadiums in Europe  Stadiums instituted several mitigations to safeguard the spectators although reports of transmission were still present  The major challenges were the gatherings outside the stadiums that might have contributed to these observations  Targeted restrictions might be required during mass sport events especially in the presence of highly transmissible variant s  and low vaccination rates among the young generation,",

"A Study of the Impact of Social Media on Society. Social media has become an integral part of our society, providing a platform to connect with family and friends around the world. However, while social media can provide many benefits it is important that we consider its impact on individuals and society at large. This essay will explore how social media has changed our lives for better or worse, discussing both positive and negative effects. One way in which social media has had a great impact is by allowing people to stay connected more easily than ever before. With just one click, you can contactor even video chat withalmost anyone around the globe instantly Through this connection, people have been able to form online communities where they share advice and experiences related to their common interests  something not possible before this technology existed. Additionally, since information can be posted quickly and read almost immediately after being shared by someones connections, news stories are now spread far faster than traditional print publications could manage in yeaster years. Social media also enables quick action such as petitioning governments, resulting in activists achieving results much more quickly than would be possible without these platforms. On the other hand, it is important to recognize some of the negative impacts that social media use may have on individuals and society at large. For example, there exists an echo chamber effect when users interact with only those who agree with them politically or socially  leading to increased polarization among different opinions instead of constructive debates or conversations about differences between views. Furthermore spending too much time scrolling through updates can lead users into feelings of envy towards others successes or jealousy when seeing personal posts from friends having fun without them  resulting in real life unhappiness or depression if unchecked over longer periods . Moreover because content goes viral so quickly via these platforms , misinformation often spreads uncontrollably faster than truth verifying teams can react creating false public opinion which further add fuel false political agendas . Finally cyberbullying happens all too,",

"The COVID19 pandemic has collapsed the health systems of many countries in the world and comorbidities in adults have exponentially increased their mortality  in matters of asthma  it has not been possible to establish a defining relationship in mortality  The clinical manifestations of asthmatic patients with SARS COV 2 are presented in a wide range  from asymptomatic to those who experience acute respiratory failure  The most sensitive method for the diagnosis of SARSCoV2 infection is RTPCR  Antigen and serologic tests are quicker than RTPCR  but they are less sensitive  Radiologic studies and the computed tomography of the chest assist in the diagnosis and followup of SARSCoV2 infection  The use of spirometry for diagnosis and followup is restricted due to the elevated risk of contagion  It has been shown that eosinophilia and TH2 inflammation  due to their antiviral immune effect  are protective factors against severe SARSCoV2 COVID19  Patients with mild asthma express less angiotensin converting enzyme receptors  ACE2   and those with neutrophilic asthma express it in greater proportion  which suggests more severe presentations of COVID19  The conventional asthma treatment modulates the SARSCoV2 COVID19 immune response  which is why patients with controlled asthma have nonsevere manifestations of COVID 19  however  the mechanisms are not clear,",

"OBJECTIVES  One consequence of social distancing during the coronavirus disease 2019  COVID19  pandemic was an increase in alcohol use disorders  We postulated that this would be associated with a rise in alcoholrelated gastrointestinal and liver disease  METHODS  Using Explorys Inc   an aggregate of electronic health records from US health care systems from 1999 to June 2021  we identified patients with  alcoholic hepatitis    inflammation of pancreas caused by alcohol   and  alcoholic gastritis   based on Systematized Nomenclature of MedicineClinical Terms  SNOMEDCT   We compared patients utilizing health care during the pandemic to those before it  RESULTS  We identified 8 445 720 patients treated from June 21  2020 to June 20  2021   COVID cohort   and 65 587 860 patients treated before this   preCOVID cohort    African American patients were more likely to be treated for all causes during COVID19  odds ratio  OR   1 65  P0 0001   Alcoholic hepatitis  OR  2 77   alcoholic pancreatitis  OR  3 67   and alcoholic gastritis  OR  1 70   for each  P0 0001  were more likely in all patients in the COVID cohort  African Americans in the COVID cohort were more likely to be diagnosed with alcoholic hepatitis  OR  2 63   alcoholic pancreatitis  OR  2 17   and alcoholic gastritis  OR  3 09   for each  P0 0001   CONCLUSIONS  The prevalence of alcoholrelated liver and gastrointestinal disease increased during COVID19  We suspect these increases are associated with increased alcohol use disorder resulting from the stress of social isolation  These data suggest COVID19 disproportionately affected African Americans in overall health care utilization and increased burden of alcoholic gastrointestinal and liver disease,",

"The coronavirus disease that emerged in 2019  COVID19  has affected health  societies and economies  Policies that have been imposed by different countries to slow the spread of the disease  including national lockdowns  curfews  border closures and enforcement of social distancing measures have disturbed the drug supply chain and resulted in drug shortages  Uncertainty concerning the pandemic has also led to the panic buying of drugs and the stockpiling of drugs in households  which has amplified the problem  In this crosssectional study  a selfdeveloped questionnaire was distributed online in order to a  assess the practice of household drug stockpiling prior to the national lockdown in Jordan  b  investigate the factors affecting it and c  measure peoples  knowledge about the consequences of this behaviour  Results from this study show that drug purchasing was reported by 44 3  of the participants and was most common among participants from nonmedical backgrounds  336  75 7   or those who have chronic diseases  261  58 8   and taking chronic supplements  282  63 5   regardless of their age  gender  living area or the possession of health insurance  Analgesics and antipyretics were the most frequently purchased drugs  225  70 5   and anticipation of their need was the most common reason for purchasing drugs  231  52 0    Buyers were also less aware  when compared to nonbuyers  that panic buying and drug stockpiling may lead to drug shortages  204  45 9  vs 325  58 1   and that this behaviour can pose a health hazard  especially to children  221  47 5  vs 342  61 2    Our study shows that panic buying of drugs and household drug stockpiling were common in Jordan during the COVID19 pandemic and this was related to participants  medical knowledge and educational backgrounds  Therefore  educating the general population regarding rational drug use is urgently needed  This is also a compelling case for the development of national guidelines for drug management that target the general population and healthcare personnel  especially pharmacists  to avoid drug shortages during crises,",

"It is true that the state of Americas educational system leaves much to be desired. Despite everincreasing funding, public elementary, middle and high schools have failed to keep up with changing trends in teaching methods, leaving many American students behind when it comes to basics like literacy and numeracy. However, one area of education that has been steadily improving over the past decade is career technical education CTE. CTE programs are designed to give students access to realworld skills such as coding and computer programming, web design and development, robotics engineering and 3D printingall invaluable tools for success in todays economy. A growing number of states are now including CTE courses in their K12 curricula. These courses can not only provide an interesting alternative to more traditional classes but also prepare students for college or a future job straight out of high school. For example, some schools offer CTE courses specifically tailored toward certain industries such as manufacturing, healthcare or finance. By gaining handson experience through these kinds of classes before graduating from high school or college, students can better understand whats expected from them by employers once they enter the workforce. Additionally this knowledge could help them decide which careers might best suit their interests or abilities before beginning higher education programs. CTE also helps bridge the gap between high school achievement levels among different races and socioeconomic groups because all children get access to training in fields that may otherwise remain closed off due to financial constraints on families who cannot afford private tutoring services or other specialized resources outside of school hours . Moreover , since most jobs require basic technological knowledge nowadays , those without a good grasp on tech skills cannot compete effectively against other applicants even if they possess natural talent . Through early exposure to CTE topics , all children gain an equal opportunity at finding successful employment later on life regardless of their socio  economic background .

"The history of mathematics is filled with interesting developments and discoveries. While the ancient Greeks and Romans made important contributions to the field, it was not until the Middle Ages that mathematical knowledge advanced significantly. This period saw great advancements in algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and arithmetic. Mathematics has since been applied to diverse fields such as astronomy, engineering, economics and finance. In antiquity, mathematicians were focused on solving problems related to areas like navigation or surveying land boundaries using rightangle triangles. Ancient Egyptians used a primitive form of arithmetic for tracking goods while Babylonian scholars developed an early base 10 numbering system along with complex math tables necessary for surveying their large empire. Meanwhile Chinese mathematicians figured out how to calculate square roots while Indian scholars worked out theoretical ideas about infinity and zero before anyone else did so in Europe. Later Europeans became more interested in developing abstract theories rather than practical applications during the high middle ages when Euclidean Geometry emerged as a major area of study thanks largely due to works by Greek mathematician Euclid who wrote Elements which outlined various concepts including how lines intersect or circles can be described mathematically among other things. Concurrently Persian scholar AlKhwarizmi wrote many influential treatises about algebraic equations including his famed book Algorithm from which its namesake derived from  algorithm a stepbystep procedure. During this time Islamic advances also left its mark on mathematics particularly through Arabic translations of Greek texts into their native language making them accessible for later European authors during what we now call the Renaissance period when Johannes Kepler famously established three laws applicable across different astronomical models often credited as ushering forth modern science itself. . By 1637 French philosopher Rene Descartes published La Geometrie further advancing analytic geometry  allowing two dimensional shapes like circles  ellipses being understood within Cartesian coordinate systems .

"The beauty of art is often overlooked in our fastpaced modern world. Art has the power to transform a space, elicit emotion within an observer, and create lasting memories that are timeless through its unique ability to capture moments in time. While art can take many forms and be created with various mediums, painting remains one of the most popular methods used by artists throughout history. As a form of selfexpression, it offers endless possibilities when creating works of art as each brush stroke speaks volumes about what lies beneath the surface. Oil painting is one such method which requires patience and dedication due to its laborious nature  but this doesnt mean we should shy away from attempting it ourselves With practice anyone can master oil painting techniques you simply need supplies such as oils paints, brushes and canvases before getting started. The process begins with choosing a subject matter for your piece if youre stuck for ideas why not start with something close to home Whether its landscapes or loved ones  use these familiar topics to inspire creativity in your work Once decided upon youll need to consider composition where elements will be placed, tonal values lightdark and colour relations  all factors that enhance the mood or feeling created by your artwork. When starting out there may be some mistakes made along the way however dont let this hold you back  failure provides us with valuable lessons that allow us to grow as artists so embrace each experience no matter how challenging Finally remember that oil paintings take time so have fun while creating them  explore different effects seen in other painterly styles or aim high by setting yourself creative goals ensuring progression over time. . At their core paintings are stories told without words but instead colors  so put brush to canvas today because everyone has an artist inside them just waiting for expression through paint,",

"Human corneal endothelium  HCE  is a single layer of hexagonal cells that lines the posterior surface of the cornea  It forms the barrier that separates the aqueous humor from the rest of the corneal layers  stroma and epithelium layer   This layer plays a fundamental role in maintaining the hydration and transparency of the cornea  which in turn ensures a clear vision  In vivo  human corneal endothelial cells  HCECs  are generally believed to be nonproliferating  In many cases  due to their nonproliferative nature  any damage to these cells can lead to further issues with Descemet s membrane  DM   stroma and epithelium which may ultimately lead to hazy vision and blindness  Endothelial keratoplasties such as Descemet s stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty  DSAEK  and Descemet s membrane endothelial keratoplasty  DEK  are the standard surgeries routinely used to restore vision following endothelial failure  Basically  these two similar surgical techniques involve the replacement of the diseased endothelial layer in the center of the cornea by a healthy layer taken from a donor cornea  Globally  eye banks are facing an increased demand to provide corneas that have suitable features for transplantation  Consequently  it can be stated that there is a significant shortage of corneal grafting tissue  for every 70 corneas required  only 1 is available  Nowadays  eye banks face long waiting lists due to shortage of donors  seriously aggravated when compared with previous years  due to the global COVID19 pandemic  Thus  there is an urgent need to find alternative and more sustainable sources for treating endothelial diseases  such as utilizing bioengineering to use of biomaterials as a remedy  The current review focuses on the use of biomaterials to repair the corneal endothelium  A range of biomaterials have been considered based on their promising results and outstanding features  including previous studies and their key findings in the context of each biomaterial,",

"Education is paramount to both personal and societal development. It is the foundation for an individuals journey of learning throughout life, as well as being a necessary component for advancement in todays world. The value of education can be seen through its integral role in the improvement of ones quality of life, their understanding and appreciation of the complexities that surround them, and ultimately the progress that society has achieved over generations. Throughout history there have been numerous examples of how education has enabled people to escape poverty and make great strides towards establishing sustainable societies. From ancient civilizations such as Greece which developed new forms of government based on democracy to modern day technologies such as AI which have revolutionized industry it is clear to see how advancements in knowledge are responsible for major changes across cultures all over the world. In many countries educational systems exist with a purpose to cultivate these advances by providing citizens with access to opportunities that would otherwise remain out of reach if only learned through experience or tailender methods. The importance placed on education can also be demonstrated by looking at various aspects within our lives from science and mathematics, language arts, physical activities and more recently technical skills such as coding programming languages used most notably in software engineering projects or web design initiatives.

"Creative writing has become an increasingly popular pastime over the years. It provides a way for people to express themselves and explore their emotions through different forms of art. One particular form of creative writing that is gaining more attention is flash fiction, or stories composed in just a few hundred words. Flash fiction can be used to tell all kinds of stories, from bittersweet tragedies to lighthearted comedy pieces. Despite being so short, these stories still require careful development and thoughtprovoking themes in order to really draw readers in. There are many challenges associated with this type of writing it takes skill and knowledge to craft a story within such tight constraints without sacrificing any quality or depth along the way. The beauty of flash fiction lies in its ability to capture so much emotion within just a few words  something that requires creativity as well as technical knowledge about storytelling techniques like plot structure and character development. Being able to convey complex ideas while keeping the story concise is essential when it comes to creating a captivating piece of flash fiction. This also allows writers who have limited time available for writing projects because they can quickly produce highquality works that connect with readers no matter how brief they may be. Ultimately, flash fiction offers aspiring authors an opportunity not only sharpen their skills but also hone their craft by learning how powerful brevity can truly be when telling stories  both long and short ones alike By mastering this style of creative writing, one will surely achieve success no matter what field or genre they pursue next,",

"The world is an everevolving place, with changes in technology and an influx of new ideas occurring every day. One particular subject that has changed drastically over time is mathematics. Mathematics has long been used to solve problems and gain insights into the world around us, but its applications have become much more varied and complex in recent years. From medical breakthroughs to advances in engineering, mathematics continues to be a major factor in our lives today. At its core, mathematics involves problem solving and logical thinking  two skills that are essential for success regardless of what we do or where we go. Being able to evaluate data critically helps us make better decisions about our lives by understanding causeandeffect relationships between variables this includes analyzing trends in business or predicting the outcome of elections based on polling numbers. It also aids scientists as they work towards unlocking the mysteries of nature for example, physicists use mathematical models to formulate theories about how particles behave when exposed to certain forces. In addition, math plays an integral role in everyday tasks like balancing a budget or navigating through unfamiliar cities with GPS technology  both are rooted heavily on basic principles from geometry and algebra Technology is advancing rapidly as well algorithms allow computers to process huge amounts of data quickly while artificial intelligence AI systems can learn from their mistakes just like humans do. This means that machines are now able to perform tasks much faster than even before  such as recognizing patterns among stock prices or diagnosing diseases using medical imaging techniques  allowing physicians and financial advisors alike access important information quicker than ever before. All these advancements show just how far mathematics has come since its beginnings centuries ago today its not only helping us unlock new solutions at home but also contributing significantly towards progress across all sectors globally Whether youre studying economics, physics or any other scientific field developing your knowledge base regarding maths will always be beneficial no matter where life takes you next,",

"Yes  they could  and obviously should  but for maximal profit I think they want to both charge the power users like governments  influence agencies  etc  much higher rates  and also be able to fully monetize anyone using their product  which is not possible through a third party  Imagine if they introduced a very unpopular feature  such as video advertisements that greatly jack up their revenue  but are easily circumvented through third party apps  They have spent years crafting a strategy of acquiring as many users as possible without being profitable  are they can t have escape routes for these users once they start monetizing them at higher rates ,",

"In tech  average tenures are so short  Someone who started in 2017  then worked 3 years  then stuck it out for another 3 to the present has a higher tenure than average and they ve survived multiple performance review cycles  They ve self selected into being very productive  The hiring bar got dropped in 2021 2022 to let in a lot of people who wouldn t traditionally  make it  in tech  Someone who joined in that timeframe is probably less productive because they are not as skilled of an employee  on average across all people who joined and are still at the company   The problem with RTO is there s no saying that this person hired in 2017 or 2021 moved away from their former office  If the 2017 person comes in with a huge commute and quits after 2 weeks  that s a loss for the company  If the 2021 person comes in to the office and improves marginally  but then quits for a fully remote position 6 months in  putting them at average 2 5 year tenure  that s a win  I d be willing to bet that the company is going to lose a lot more talent pound for pound from those people in the first bucket than they re going to gain from people in the second bucket ,",

"COVID19 vaccines are safe and highly effective  but some individuals experience unpleasant reactions to vaccination  As the majority of adults in the US have received a COVID19 vaccine this year  there is an unprecedented opportunity to study the genetics of reactions to vaccination via surveys of individuals who are already part of genetic research studies  Here  we have queried 17 440 participants in the Helix DNA Discovery Project and Healthy Nevada Project about their reactions to COVID19 vaccination  Our GWAS identifies an association between severe difficulties with daily routine after vaccination and HLAA 03 01  This association was statistically significant only for those who received the PfizerBioNTech vaccine  BNT162b2  n 3 694  p 4 70E11  OR 2 07  95 CI 1 672 56    and showed a smaller effect size in those who received the Moderna vaccine  mRNA1273  n 3 610  p 0 005  OR 1 32  95 CI 1 091 59    In PfizerBioNTech recipients  HLAA 03 01 was associated with a twofold increase in risk of selfreported severe difficulties with daily routine following vaccination  The effect was consistent across ages  sexes  and whether the person had previously had a COVID19 infection  The reactions experienced by HLAA 03 01 carriers were driven by associations with chills  fever  fatigue  and in general feeling unwell,",

"Background Due to the current COVID19 pandemic  there has been an increase in the need for the virtual followup of patients  These innovations in clinical care have helped to reduce hospital attendance of patients and the spread of the virus  Injuries such as wrist fractures that are nonobligatory are increasingly being followed up virtually  This paper compares the early experience of management of wrist fractures in a District General Hospital in the United Kingdom during the COVID19 pandemic lockdown with a similar period before  Methods A retrospective study of the management and clinical followup of all skeletally mature patients seen in the Accident and Emergency  A E  department with a radiologically confirmed distal radius fracture after imposition of COVID19 lockdown measures in the United Kingdom  between March 23  2020 and May 24  2020   and comparison with a control group of patients with distal radius fractures seen within a similar time frame the previous year  March 23  2019 to May 24  2019   Results During the COVID19 lockdown  a total of 39 skeletally mature patients  85  females  average age of 70 4 years  SD  14 6   who had suffered a wrist fracture were seen  A total of 23  of the patients had surgical fixation  The others were managed conservatively and followed up regularly in the fracture clinic and by virtual telephone consultation in 15   p  0 05  compared to the previous year  Three patients who had an AO OTA TypeC fracture were not keen on surgery  citing the COVID19 pandemic  Patients had their operations at 5 2 days postinjury on average compared to the preCOVID average of 6 4 days postinjury  Conclusion This preliminary study showed that patients considered  high risk   as per the UK government guidance on shielding and protecting people who are clinically extremely vulnerable from COVID19  with low functional demands who had suffered fractures of the distal radius were followed up mostly virtually after their first A E attendance  thereby eliminating unnecessary hospital attendances  There was no difference in the epidemiology of wrist fractures pre and postCOVID19 lockdown  No COVIDpositive patients were treated  The limitations of this study are the fact that it is crosssectional with a lack of patientreported outcome measures  PROM   As this was only a preliminary study to assess initial results  it will be followed up by a full report assessing outcomes at defined intervals,",

"BACKGROUND  In a previous worldwide survey  the authors showed a drastic reduction in the number of cytological specimens processed during the coronavirus disease 2019  lockdown  period along with an increase in malignancy rates  To assess the continued impact of the pandemic on cytological practices around the world  they undertook a second followup worldwide survey collecting data from the postlockdown period  2020   METHODS  Participants were asked to provide data regarding their cytopathology activity during the first 12 weeks of their respective national postlockdown period  2020   which ranged from April 4 to October 31  Differences between the postlockdown period and the corresponding 2019 period were evaluated  and the authors specifically focused on rates of malignant diagnoses  RESULTS  A total of 29 respondents from 17 countries worldwide joined the survey  Overall  a lower number of cytological specimens  n   236 352  were processed in comparison with the same period in 2019  n   321 466  for a relative reduction of 26 5   The overall malignancy rate showed a statistically significant increase  12 442  5 26   vs 12 882  4 01    P   001  during the same time period  Similar results were obtained if both malignancy and suspicious for malignancy rates were considered together  15 759  6 58   vs 16 011  4 98    P   001   CONCLUSIONS  The data showed a persistent reduction in the cytological specimen volume during the postlockdown period  2020   However  the relative increase in the cytological workload in the late part of the postlockdown is a promising finding of a slow return to normality,",

"The current work provides a multimethods exploration of how withinperson subtypes of selforiented perfectionism  SOP  and socially prescribed perfectionism  SPP  were related to shifts in healthpromoting behaviors among adolescents following the onset of the COVID19 pandemic  Study One tested the 2 x 2 and tripartite models of perfectionism through a quantitative test of how such subtypes predicted changes in health behaviors prepandemic to intrapandemic among 202 adolescents  M   17 86  SD   1 421   Results indicated that the combination of high SOP high SPP was linked to the most maladaptive changes to healthpromoting behaviors  supporting the tripartite model  Study Two aimed to contextualize these findings by analyzing semistructured interviews with 31 adolescent selfidentified perfectionists  M   15 97  SD   1 991  during the initial lockdown mandate  Results indicated that participants experienced a welcome break and found more time to engage in healthpromoting behaviors  However  those high in SOP  regardless of their level of SPP  had more difficulty relaxing due to a resistance to relenting their perfectionistic standards  Altogether  these findings support the exacerbating role of SOP when combined with SPP posited by the tripartite model of perfectionism with respect to adolescents  healthpromoting behaviors during the COVID19 pandemic,",
